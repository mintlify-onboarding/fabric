title: "Adding Item Variants"

### Overview

Item variants are different versions of a base product that shoppers can choose from. With variants, you can offer an extensive catalog on your storefront, giving shoppers various options for the same item, such as size, color, or material. You can create and manage any number of combinations of options for variations of an item in fabric.

For example, a store sells a dining table in three different materials: oak, pine, or mahogany. Each material comes in options that accommodate 4, 6, or 8 people. Using the variants, you can create 9 different variations for the parent item, the dining table, as shown in the following table:

| Oak         | Pine         | Mahogany      |                   |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Seats 4** | Oak, seats 4 | Pine, seats 4 | Mahogany, seats 4 |
| **Seats 6** | Oak, seats 6 | Pine, seats 6 | Mahogany, seats 6 |
| **Seats 8** | Oak, seats 8 | Pine, seats 8 | Mahogany, seats 8 |

With the above settings, the storefront displays the parent item with 9 options. Each of these options is a variant of the parent item and is referred to as the child item.

There are two ways to create a variant for an item:

* **Select existing items:** Use this method to add variants to an item by selecting from the items that are already present in your items list. You can use this method only if the desired item specifications or attributes already exist within your catalog.
* **Create variants:** Use this method when you want to introduce an item with new attributes or specifications as a variant of a pre-existing item. In this method, you can simultaneously create a new item and set it as a variant of an existing item.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have at least one item in your list to use the **Create variants** method of creating variants.
