## Introduction

Batch Order Processing allows for items from multiple orders to be picked at the same time.

To begin batch processing, start on the Fulfillments main screen and apply a filter. Once the filter is applied, switch to the **Items** tab.

The Items tab will show all items that meet the filter criteria, regardless of which order they’re a part of. The ratio indicates how many of an item is required to fulfill all orders that meet the search criteria. 

Press the **Scan** button to begin scanning the items. When finished scanning all items in the orders, press **Done**. You will be returned to the Items tab and see a “No Items Found” message to let you know that you have successfully picked all items in the orders that match the filters you have applied.
