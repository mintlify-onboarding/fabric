#### A library of all imports and exports

The History page shows a record of all imported and exported files from the Order Management and Inventory pages.

Both the Orders and Inventory options display the following information:

* Log ID: the name of the import or export
* Type: whether the file was an import or an export
* Status: whether the file is processing or finished, or if there is an error
* Created: date and time the file was created
* Message: any additional details of the import or export. If the imported file had errors, you will see the vertical elipses icon to the right. Click on the icon, and then select **Download Error Report CSV** to download the file with errors so that you can correct them and then reupload.
