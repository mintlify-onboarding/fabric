### Overview

Bundles are combinations of two or more products sold exclusively together or individually, depending on the configuration. Pure bundles consist of items exclusively sold together, and individual items cannot be purchased separately. Shoppers have the flexibility to buy items in mixed bundles together or separately.

For example, in a living room furniture set consisting of a coffee table and an end table, shoppers can choose to purchase each table individually or buy both tables together as part of the _living room set_ bundle.
