Subscriptions' recurring payment setup ensures secure payments without repetitive customer activity. 

## Prerequisites

Copilot is the primary interface for working with fabric applications. You will need an active account, including an account ID, to access Copilot. Contact your Copilot Admin or Customer Success representative to obtain these credentials.

Subscriptions must be connected to a front-end such as a web storefront or mobile app to display content and facilitate interaction.

Subscriptions is designed to work in conjunction with fabric PIM and Offers. Contact your customer success representative to obtain integration instructions if you plan on using third-party services.
