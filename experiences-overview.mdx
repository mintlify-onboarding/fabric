fabric Experiences enables content creation and layout. You can preview what you make, create different versions, and schedule your content for future publication. 

Your development team will provide custom reusable components that you can use in Experiences to create extensible designs for a variety of media, including web browsers, mobile applications, and tablets.

Examples of components include:

| Global navigation elements | Promo banners                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Page headers and footers   | Hero images                       |
| Image tiles and carousels  | Support pages                     |
| Text fields                | Product and category detail pages |
| Site-wide banners          | Articles                          |

## Prerequisites

Copilot is the primary interface for working with fabric applications. You will need an active account, including an account ID, to access Copilot. Contact your Copilot Admin or Customer Success representative to obtain these credentials.

Experiences must be connected to a front-end such as a web storefront or mobile app to display content and facilitate interaction.

## Launching Experiences

To launch Experiences, log in to your Copilot account and select **Experiences** from the top menu bar or the **Experiences** tile on the **Home** page.

## Navigation

Experiences is divided into sections that are accessible from the left menu:

* [Pages](/docs/experiences-pages) \- individual content pages for products, services, blogs and other information
* [Global Elements](/docs/experiences-global-elements) \- headers, footer, site-wide banners, and other elements common to many pages
* [Menu](/docs/experiences-menu) \- central site navigation structures
* [Menu v2](/docs/experiences-menu-v2) \- version, schedule, and publish different menu options

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

fabric Copilot provides the ability to restrict the access of different users to information and actions available to them through roles. For more information and instructions on how to set up these controls, [visit the RBAC documentation](/docs/role-based-access-control).
