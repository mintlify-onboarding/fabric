## Introduction

Suppliers send products to their retailer partners in fabric Marketplace, either in the form of proposals within the Marketplace system, or in the form of spreadsheets the retailers use to create Import Requests based on their connection settings with the supplier.

As a retailer, once you receive products in your catalog from the supplier, you might need to update some of the products' information before publishing them to your store. This is done by updating the items using the **Import Products & Attributes** feature.

## Import Products & Attributes

Click on **Products** in the menu across the top of Marketplace. On the Products page, select **Import Products & Attributes**.

On the Import Products page, use the **Select Template** dropdown to select a template for the products you’re importing. This will ensure that the data in the file you import is mapped to the the product in your store correctly. Use the Download Empty Template and/or Show Headers buttons to verify you’re uploading to the intended template and format. To learn about templates and how to create them, visit the [Templates](/docs/marketplace-retailers-templates) page.

Use the **Select File** field to upload the product spreadsheet.

Once the import is complete, you will see a summary of the import process, including its status.

### Import History
