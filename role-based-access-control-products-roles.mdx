### Overview

User roles have predefined permissions in fabric. This page covers the roles as they relate to the Products application and their unique capabilities within each Products menu:

* **Admin:** Manages product settings including attribute mapping and attribute groups. With this role, you can publish or unpublish an item or bundle, and delete items, bundles, and categories.
* **Editor:** Creates and updates content and sends changes for review.
* **Viewer:** Views content but cannot create, update, or delete content. Viewers cannot manage product settings.

### List and Details

The List menu is where products are imported, reviewed, and revised.
