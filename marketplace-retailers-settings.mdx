## Introduction

To access Retailer Settings, click on your account name in the menu at the top of the page. In the dropdown menu that appears, select **Retailer Settings**.

Use the tiles on the Retailer Settings page to manage everything from general information and user privileges to API clients and webhook settings.

## Default Onboarding Preferences

Manage the default onboarding settings for all new suppliers. 

The settings you configure here will be the default settings for all new connections. You can always override these settings when inviting a new connection.

Each of these preferences is set for a new vendor automatically. These preferences can be changed for an individual vendor by going to their Connection Details Page.

### Default Cost Determination

All incoming items on a purchase order must have an associated cost to the retailer. Use the **Cost Method** dropdown menu to make a selection:

**Specified on Platform:** Marketplace is responsible for capturing the cost in this scenario. For Proposals, an attribute called “Cost” becomes mandatory for all of a supplier’s items. It is implemented through rulesets being used by Proposal Departments and requires that suppliers define the value for the “Cost” attribute for every item when creating a proposal. For Import Requests, the same “Cost” attribute becomes mandatory for all items created by the retailer, and retailers will not be able to send import requests without the “Cost” attribute.

**Specified on Order:** The retailer is responsible of providing the value of “Net Price” with every order they create in Marketplace. Orders created without “Net Price” or “Retailer Price” will be rejected by the system. 

**Commission:** The retailer must specify the commission amount. Marketplace will automatically calculate the cost to be paid to the supplier based on the retail price in every item. Retailers need to provide the “Retail Price” while creating an order in Marketplace. Any order without the Retail Price will be rejected. The net price will be calculated based on the commission and retail price.

After making a selection, click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Fulfillment SLA

The Fulfillment SLA governs how long suppliers have to ship orders before they are considered late.

Use the dropdown to choose whether suppliers have one, two, or three business days to ship orders once they receive the order.

After making a selection, click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Payment Terms

The retailer pays the cost of all the items on a purchase order. The Payment Terms reflect how long the retailer has in credit days before that amount is due to the supplier. For example, if set to Net 15, the retailer will need to remit the supplier within 15 days of invoice receipt.

Use the dropdown to make a selection and then click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Catalog Import Method

The catalog import method defines how suppliers share their product catalog with you. 

Selecting **Import Requests** requires you to upload a spreadsheet on behalf of your suppliers and subsequently seek the their approval to publish the products. 

Selecting **Proposals** requires suppliers to submit products to you for approval.

After making a selection, click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Customer Service & Returns Allowance

Setting a customer service & returns allowance on a connection automatically applies an adjustment to all new incoming supplier invoices, decreasing the amount the retailer owes the supplier.

This allowance is typically applied to offset the costs of returns and other costs associated with servicing a customer. 

To set a default returns allowance for any new connections automatically, enter a value between 0 and 10% and then click the **Save Preference** button.

### Packing Slip Template

Including a retailer-branded packing slip is often an important component of the customer experience. The default packing slip will include your logo and core order data including the customer order number. 

If you have worked with fabric Support to configure a custom packing slip, please provide the template name and click the **Save Preference** button.
