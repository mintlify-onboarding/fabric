title: "Importing Product Attributes"

### Overview

Product attributes are specific product descriptors that define characteristics such as size, color, or material. This document covers the process of importing multiple product attributes using a CSV file. You also have the option to add product attributes manually. 

### CSV File Guidelines

Product attributes can be imported using CSV files exclusively, as fabric does not support other data or file formats. Here are some essential points to keep in mind:

* The headers in the first row of the CSV file should match the attribute titles.
* While attribute titles are not case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original attribute titles is recommended.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.
* We recommend downloading the template file to serve as a guide when creating your own CSV file for import, minimizing errors during the process.

### Attribute Data Formatting

When preparing your CSV file for import, ensure that the product attribute data format aligns with the column requirements. Different columns have specific data input requirements:

* **Attribute Title:** The name of the attribute.
* **Type of Attribute:** The type of the attribute such as text, number, date, Boolean, serial, or list of values.
* (Optional) **Description:** Details about the attribute.
* **Decimal:** Indicates whether the attribute allows decimal values. The options are **true**, which indicates that the attribute allows decimal values, and **false**, which indicates that only whole numbers are accepted. This setting is relevant only for number-type attributes. The default value is **true**.
* (Optional) **Min**: The minimum value for attribute validation. This setting is relevant for number-type attributes only.
* (Optional)**Max**: The maximum value for attribute validation. This setting is relevant for number-type attributes only.
* **Date Format:** The date format, such as MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD, and YYYY-MM-DD. This field is mandatory for date-type attributes. Without a format, the attribute will not be imported.
* (Optional)**Calculation Formula**:The JavaScript formula to calculate attribute values.
* (Optional)**Validations Formula**: The JavaScript formula to set business validations on attribute values.
* **Mandatory:** This field defines whether the attribute is mandatory or optional. Acceptable values are true and false.
* **Start With**: The starting serial number. This setting is only applicable for serial-type attributes.
* **Increment by:** The increment size for the serial-type attribute.
* **Options Select Type (List of Value):** Required to create a list of values-type attribute. Acceptable values in this column are true and false. Use the Value 1, Value 2, Value 3 columns to the right to provide the value options. You can add more columns following the same pattern.
