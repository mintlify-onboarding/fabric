title: "Creating a System App"
---

### Overview

A **System App** is a type of API app that generates an access token to identify itself using a client ID and client secret. System Apps do not use fabric Identity to authenticate end users; rather they use system-to-system communications with fabric APIs. If you are using your own identity provider, you should create a System App.
