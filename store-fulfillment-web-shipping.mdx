## Introduction

Shipping is the third step in the fulfillment process. In fabric Orders, shipping can refer to traditional shipment via a carrier or pickup by the customer. 

## Shipping

Once all items in the customer’s order have been added to a parcel, the **Ship** button at the bottom of the screen is enabled. Click it to begin shipping the order.

The **Do you want to proceed?** popup appears containing a prompt to review the order’s value-added services (e.g. installation, gift wrapping, etc.). To proceed, click **View items** and the popup advances to **Value Added Services**. From there, click on items to see their VAS options. When finished, click **Proceed to ship**.

The popup advances to **Pick shipping method**, where all of the shipping methods are displayed. Choose a method and click **Select Shipping Method** to continue. 

### Ship Stage

The ship stage screen has an overview of the order to this point:

* **Order Details** shows the customer’s Name, Phone number, Email address, and Location.
* **Parcels** shows the number of parcels and the items included in each.
* **Shipping Carrier** displays the selected shipping method.

Click the **Generate Labels** button at the bottom of the page to continue. 

The Print Labels popup will appear, which gives you options to **Print shipping labels** and **Print packing slips**. Clicking the print icon will open the corresponding file as a PDF. 

Click **Cancel** to close the Print Labels popup. 

**Print pick list** and **Reprint shipping labels** can be accessed again by clicking on the ellipses at the top-right of the page.
