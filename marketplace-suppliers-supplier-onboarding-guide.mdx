## Introduction

Welcome to fabric Marketplace. This guide will walk you through the supplier onboarding workflow.

## Welcome Email

The Marketplace onboarding process begins with a welcome email that contains a unique link to Marketplace that will connect you to your retail partner. The email will come from [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#761b17041d1302061a1715130503060619040236101714041f15581f1815).

**Note:** If you are having trouble finding your invitation email, start by checking your spam folder. If you still can’t find the invitation email, ask the retailer who invited you or your fabric onboarding specialist to resend the invitation email. If you still don’t receive the email, reach out to fabric Support at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#582b2d2828372a2c182b2d2828372a2c3e393a2a313b76223d363c3d2b33763b3735).

After clicking the link to begin the onboarding process, you will be directed to the Sign Up screen.

* If you are new to Marketplace and do not have an account, select **I am new to fabric Marketplace** to set up your account.
* If you already have an account, select **I already have a fabric Marketplace account**.

Once you have completed initial account setup and logged in, you’ll be asked some basic questions about your experience with dropshipping in the **Welcome to fabric Marketplace!** questionnaire.

After completing the questionnaire, schedule your introductory call with one of fabric’s supplier onboarding specialists. The supplier onboarding team will be notified of the date and time you scheduled and review your answers.

Prior to your onboarding call, log in to Marketplace to access your supplier account. During the call, the onboarding specialist will go through each item on the onboarding task checklist to walk you through the platform and answer any questions. 

We recommend that you invite any members of your team who may be using Marketplace to join the onboarding call.

## Onboarding Tasks

After your onboarding call, you will need to complete the onboarding tasks to finish the onboarding process.

The **Onboarding Tasks** page has a checklist that includes setup tasks like adding:

* Billing information
* Fulfillment address
* Additional users
* Selecting a preferred integration type (if you opt in to one of our integrations, a member of our supplier deliver team will join the call to help assist with setup and testing)
* Product upload and approval settings
* User notification settings

The Onboarding Tasks page is accessible by clicking on **fabric Home** from the menu at the top of the page in Marketplace and selecting **Onboarding**.

Marketplace will also remind you of any incomplete tasks whenever you log in by displaying the **Continue Onboarding** popup.

### Billing Address

Click **Start** next to the Billing Address section of the Onboarding Tasks page to add your address.

The billing address is for all payment remittances and other communication with the retailer and Marketplace. Fill out the Legal Business Name field, as well as all of the other address fields.

When finished, click **Continue**.

### Default Fulfillment Location

Click **Start** next to the Default Fulfillment Location section of the Onboarding Tasks page to add your Default Fulfillment Location.

The Default Fulfillment Location serves as the default warehouse for all of your orders. It is mandatory to set up your default warehouse before proceeding as a supplier.

When finished, click **Continue**.

**Note:** After you set up the default location, you can add more locations (warehouses) by clicking on **fabric Home** from the menu at the top of the page in Marketplace, selecting **Supplier Settings**, and then clicking on **Inventory Settings**.

### Primary Contacts

Click **Start** next to the Primary Contacts section of the Onboarding Tasks page to add contacts at your organization.

Three contacts are required to complete this task:

* The **Primary Business Contact** is notified of any policy- or business-related changes to your relationship with the retailer.
* The **Merchandising Contact** is contacted by the retailer to discuss things related to merchandising, proposals, and products being dropshipped with the retailer.
* The **Fulfillment Contact** is contacted by the retailer whenever there is an issue with order fulfillment, such as delays, missing shipments, or order cancellation.

 When finished, click **Complete Task**.

### Transactions Integration

Click **Start** next to the Transactions Integration section of the Onboarding Tasks page.

Marketplace supports multiple methods to trade inventory, order, shipment, and inventory data. As a supplier, you can choose the integration(s) you want to have with Marketplace.

For low and medium order volumes, we recommend using the fabric Supplier Portal, which includes import/export tools to process orders in bulk. For higher volumes, we recommend using EDI or API.

Choose an integration method in the Integration Options window, click **Complete Task**, and then complete the following steps to finish setting up that option.

**EDI: Managed Onboarding**

Create your Marketplace EDI account by filling out the **EDI Qualifier** and **EDI ID** fields, and then clicking **Create EDI Account**. The fabric team will help you onboard your EDI.

**fabric Supplier Portal**

There are no additional steps required to set up the fabric Supplier Portal integration.

**ShipStation**

fabric can be configured to automatically push purchase orders to and pull tracking numbers from your ShipStation account. Enter your **ShipStation API Key** and **ShipStation API Secret** and then click **Continue**.

On the following screen, you can specify a ShipStation Store ID if you would like orders to land in a designated ShipStation store. Otherwise, your orders will land in your default ShipStation store. This field is optional. Enter a Store ID or leave the field blank and then click **Continue**.

The next screen allows you to select the tags you want to be added to all orders that go from Marketplace to ShipStation. If you would like fabric to tag orders, select the tag from the list below. If you need to a new tag, create it in your ShipStation account and it will be available in Marketplace instantly. When finished, click **Continue**.

**Shopify**

The Marketplace Shopify app can be installed to automatically push purchase orders into your Shopify store and pull tracking numbers once you ship. To install the app, fill out the **Shopify Store Name** and **API Key** fields and then click **Continue**.

Once your store is connected, you can configure the integration’s webhooks and other settings. Click **Continue** to finish.

**BigCommerce**

The Marketplace BigCommerce app can be installed to automatically push purchase orders into your BigCommerce store and pull tracking numbers once you ship. To install the app, fill out the **Store Identifier** and **Store Token** fields.

You can find your Store Identifier in your BigCommerce store URL. Example: store-**storeidentifier**.mybigcommerce.com/admin.

Your Store Token is the admin API Key you can generate from your BigCommerce account.

When you’ve entered your information, click **Continue**.

**WooCommerce**

The Marketplace WooCommerce app can be installed to automatically push purchase orders into your WooCommerce store and pull tracking numbers once you ship. To install the app, fill out the **WooCommerce Store URL** field and then click **Continue**.

Once your store is connected, click **Install App** to finish.

**API**

There are no additional steps required to set up an API integration.

### Catalog (Import Products/Approve Import Request)

Depending on your connection settings, you will see either **Import Products** or **Approve Import Request** for the Catalog section.

* **Import Products** means you need to create products by importing them.
* **Approve Import Request** means that your retail partner creates products and you have to approve their requests for products.

Click **Start** to begin the process.

**Import Products**

Based on the category of products you are uploading, select a template from the dropdown, choose a file to upload, and then click **Import.** 

To learn more about importing products, see [Adding products to your catalog](/docs/marketplace-suppliers-product-management#adding-products-to-your-catalog).

**Approve Import Request**

A fabric retailer will submit a request to upload a set of products on your behalf. Once submitted, this “import request” requires your approval.

When the retailer submits the import request, you will receive an email with instructions and a link to view the products and approve the request.

You don’t have to take any action at this time. Click **Complete Task** to continue onboarding.

### Notifications

Click **Start** next to the Notifications section of the Onboarding Tasks page to configure which push notifications you receive.

There are four types of notifications to configure:

* **Connection:** notifications whenever there are changes to your connections or connection notes
* **Order Received:** notifications whenever you receive an order
* **Order Change Requests:** notifications when a customer has requested a change to their order
* **Order Digest:** a notification at the end of each business day that contains a summary of that day’s new or open orders

For each step in the Notifications workflow, enter an email address to enable the notification and click **Save & Continue**. To disable the notification, click Skip Notification.

## Complete Onboarding

After you have finished all of your onboarding tasks, your retail partner will receive a notification to activate your connection. Once the retailer has activated the connection, click the **Complete Onboarding** button at the bottom of the Onboarding Tasks page. You will start receiving orders in the Marketplace portal.
