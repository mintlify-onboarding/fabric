### Overview

Collections are an alternative to categories as a way to organize products. Collections use dynamic inclusion and exclusion rules applied to existing categories to create custom item groups, or collections. Because the category system may not be granular enough to meet all the requirements of a storefront, collections are typically used to organize products according to the merchant's requirements, usually for short-term marketing campaigns. 

For example, in a furniture store, categories serve as the fundamental organizational structure, grouping products like tables, chairs, and sofas into broader classifications. Each category has defined attributes such as material, style, and color, which helps shoppers locate their desired items.

On the other hand, collections offer a dynamic and flexible way to organize products beyond the constraints of categories. For example, during the summer, a Summer Sale collection can be curated, including only furniture items with a discount of 20% or more. Similarly, a Modern Living Room collection can be formed, including items with a specific style attribute.
