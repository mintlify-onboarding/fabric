> Some of fabric's products are undergoing name changes. Marketplace (Merchants) is now Marketplace (Suppliers), but you may see the old name in some places as we make the transition.

## Initial Setup

To access Integrations, click on your account name in the menu at the top of the page. In the dropdown that appears, select **Retailer Settings**. On the Retailer Settings page, find and click on the **Integrations** tile.

On the Integrations page, click on the **Add Integration** button at the top-right of the page. In the Add Integration popup that appears, click the **Add** button in the Shopify tile.

You will be prompted to fill out your Shopify store URL and API Key. When finished, click the **Add Integration** button.

After you enter your Shopify credentials in Marketplace, you will be directed to Shopify’s website. Click the **Install unlisted app** button to install the fabric Marketplace app in your Shopify profile.

Once your credentials are entered and the app is installed, you are ready to begin configuring the various settings of your integration.

## Integration Options

On the Integrations page in fabric Marketplace, you will see the Shopify logo with an Options button next to it. Click the **Options** button and in the popup that appears, choose whether you would like to edit the **Configuration**, **Webhook History**, or **Utilities**.

## Configuration

Select **Configuration** from the **Options** dropdown on the Integration page. The Configuration page allows you to make changes related to how order and transaction information is shared between Marketplace and Shopify.

### Orders

Configure how your Shopify store syncs orders with fabric.

Marketplace can send orders directly to your Shopify store so that you can view all your orders in one place. Enabling this option allows you to fulfill orders from your Shopify store while fabric captures the fulfillment details every time an order is fulfilled.

Click the **Enable Integration** button to turn on the Push Orders to Shopify feature.

Click **Disable Integration** to turn off Push Orders to Shopify feature.

**Please note:** the Push Orders to Shopify feature affects all of your retail partners; it cannot be configured to each individual partner.

### Fulfillments

Configure how your Shopify store syncs fulfillments with fabric.

When tracking numbers are added to your fulfillments, you have the option to automatically return the tracking numbers to your Retailer partner.

Use the **Select Webhook** dropdown to choose how fabric captures fulfillment updates.

* **Fulfilment Created:** If you are using Shopify’s fulfilment method to print shipping labels, use this option to notify Marketplace about the fulfilment.
* **Fulfilment Updated:** If you are using any other external app to create fulfillments and updating them later, select this option to notify Marketplace about the fulfilment.

Once you’ve made a selection click **Enable Integration**.

To disable fulfillment sync, click the **Disable Integration** button.

### Cancellations

Configure how your Shopify store syncs full cancellations with fabric.

When you cancel an order in its entirety in Shopify, we can automatically cancel that order in fabric Marketplace.

Click the **Enable Integration** button to turn on the cancellation sync feature.

To disable cancellation sync, click the **Disable Integration** button.

**Please note:** fabric listens to both fully and partially cancelled orders, but Shopify only publishes this specific event when there is a FULL cancellation. Partial cancellations still have to be registered via the supplier portal.

### Inventory

Configure how your Shopify store syncs inventory with fabric.

With this feature enabled, Marketplace listens to the product and inventory updates in your Shopify store and updates the inventory count with the Marketplace portal in real-time. This allows you to make sure your Retailer partners have up-to-date inventory numbers.

Use the **Select Webhook** dropdown to choose how fabric sync orders, choose **Product/Inventory Updated (Recommended)**, and then click **Enable Integration**.

To disable inventory sync, click the **Disable Integration** button.

## Webhook History

Select **Webhook History** from the **Options** dropdown on the Integration page.

The Webhook History page shows details of all the events that have been captured by Marketplace from your Shopify store:

* ID: The ID of the webhook as captured by fabric Marketplace. This ID is generated by Marketplace
* Topic: The topic that was captured as part of this webhook
* Received: The timestamp of when the webhook was captured. This is in the user’s local time zone
* Has Message?: A checkmark will indicate whether or not the webhook came with an additional message, such as the reason of failure or skipping
* Status: The status of the webhook in fabric Marketplace

### Inspect Webhook

Click on a webhook ID to open the Inspect Webhook dialog. Inspect Webhook shows information captured in the webhook and includes a message to provide details on the status of the webhook.

## Utilities

Select **Utilities** from the **Options** dropdown on the Integration page.

The Utilities page features tools to troubleshoot issues and manually sync types of data between your fabric and Shopify accounts.

### Retry Fulfillment

If an order fulfillment didn't import into fabric, it's likely there was a problem processing the Shopify webhook.

Enter an order number in the **Shopify Order Number** field, click the **Retry Fulfillment Import** button, and fabric will attempt to fetch and import existing fulfillments.

### Sync Variants by Supplier

This utility attempts to sync variants between Shopify and fabric using a supplier name.

Enter a name in the **Shopify Supplier Name** field and click the **Run Sync** button.

This will search your Shopify store for all items matching the name you entered that were name created within the last 30 days, and then attempt to sync them with variants in fabric. Please enter the supplier name exactly as it appears in Shopify.

### Sync Variants by Date

This utility attempt to sync variants between Shopify and fabric using a date range.

This utility searches your Shopify store for all items created within specified date range and attempts to sync them with variants in fabric. fabric checks if the Shopify variant's SKU field matches the Merchant Retailer SKU, the UPC, or the Supplier SKU (in that order).

* **Look for products created between two given dates:** only syncs the items that were created in the specified date range. Any items outside the date range will be ignored.
* **Run Sync against all products:** syncs your entire Shopify catalog with fabric Marketplace. This process is usually very slow and can take hours, even days depending on your catalog size.

After you’ve made your selection, click **Run Sync** to begin the process.

### Sync Variant

This utility attempts to sync variants between Shopify and fabric using a fabric Item ID, which can be found on the item details page under the heading **ID**.

Enter a value in the **fabric Item ID** field and click **Run Sync**, and fabric will search your Shopify store for any items matching using the Retailer SKU, Supplier SKU, and/or UPC.
