fabric Products is a data organization tool that enables merchants to build a centralized source of product information. This information can include technical specifications such as size and weight, design specifications such as color and material, and basic details like name, description, and ID. 

Product categories allow merchants to organize items into logical parent-child groups that make it easier for shoppers to browse and find products on the storefront. While configuring Products, merchants can use validations to ensure data consistency and quality for each item and category. 

Products has out-of-the-box integrations with fabric systems like Orders and Offers that enable merchants to add base prices and promotions to any products available in Products, including categories and collections. 

Key Products capabilities include:

* **Catalog Management:** Create and manage products and services as items, variants, and bundles.
* **Taxonomy Management:** Define categories of products to create a structured hierarchy.
* **Distribution management:** Control product data availability for multiple channels and locales and use collections to curate subsets of products for sales and marketing goals.
* **Bulk Management:**Import product, category, and collection information in a CSV file and export catalog data into a CSV file.
* **Variant management:** Create and manage an unlimited number of variants to indicate that a product is available in different colors or sizes.

### Use Case

As an example, consider a furniture distributor with an extensive catalog that includes living, dining, and bedroom pieces. 

Using the Products **List** menu, the merchant can upload each item they sell, either individually or in bulk with a CSV file. Attributes of each piece, ranging from physical characteristics such as dimensions and weight to construction characteristics such as materials and finishes can all be included. Variants of items are also supported, so that a coffee table available in mahogany, oak, and pine can all be considered different versions of the same item. In addition, items frequently sold together can be grouped into bundles so that the coffee table can be sold along with a pair of matching end tables.

Using the Products **Categories** menu, the merchant can create a hierarchy of relationships among the items in the catalog that make the most sense to their business. That means the coffee table could be in a category with all living room furniture, or a category of all tables, or both. 

Using the Products **Collections** menu, the merchant can group items from different categories. This is usually done to support sales or marketing efforts. The coffee table and end tables could be put into a collection along with a sofa, loveseat, and lamps for a Black Friday sale on a living room set.
