## Pages home screen

Pages functions as your artboard to lay out and populate components such as section titles, product image carousels, and description boxes. All pages can be edited, versioned, scheduled for future publication, and archived.

Using the menu selections at the top, you can list All Pages, Page types, and Archived pages.

Clicking the **All Pages** selection will provide a list of all pages currently available for editing and publication.

To filter the list of pages to display a smaller subset, select the **Page type** dropdown and check the type(s) you wish to view.

To view your current list, click the **Page types** selection at the top of the page.

* Page Types - name you provide for this collection
* #  
of pages - current number of pages in the collection  
* Prefix - URL directory prefix for all pages in the collection

To add a new page type, click the **Add page type** button at the top of the page and complete the two fields in the modal box. This info can be modified in the future if needed.

* Page type name - Descriptive text based on your site categorization such as Product Page or Company Info.

## Add page

To create a page, select **Add page**. In the modal box, complete the following fields in the **General Details** section.

* Page type (_Optional_) – Select from list if available to categorize your pages. You can select the page type in the future if desired.
* Page name – Enter a name that is relevant to the section of your site where this page will appear such as “Kitchen - mixers.” This will be displayed in the Experiences list of pages when you need to revisit it.
* Page version – Start with 1, the date, the promotion event or the versioning methodology standard for your site.
* URL – This is the subdirectory component of your site URL and will appear as the last segment. If you enter /kitchen-mixers, the URL will appear as [www.yoursite.com/kitchen-mixers](http://www.yoursite.com/kitchen-mixers) in the browser.

In the same model box select **SEO and metadata** in the left column

* SEO title - title of page that will appear in tab
* SEO description - a brief description of the webpage that will appear on a search engine listing
* Metadata name and content - individual terms search engines will see and index regarding the page

Select **Save** and your new page appears. This information can be altered after the page is created by selecting **Edit details** in the right menu.

## Add components to a page

Components are the content building blocks in Experiences. They are created by your frontend developer using descriptor files per your custom requirements. All available components to be configured and added to your pages appear in the **Add components** list. More than one instance of a component can appear on any page.

To add content to a page, select the **Pages** link, then click on the page name. Mouse over the version you want to edit and click vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) to bring up the menu and select **Edit**.

Click **Add components** in the left column to see the list of available components for your deployment.

The component list in the left column labeled **Section** can be rearranged via drag and drop. The subcomponents cannot.

NOTE: Since all components are custom built, they will vary from this example.

In our example, we will select **Single Product Page Template**. Toggle the **Heading** arrow and a list of fields required to populate the page will appear in the left column. The other links and graphics already on the page are Global Elements that will appear on all pages.

Once the fields have been completed, the page shows the content as a preview. The phone/tablet/laptop icons at the top of page enable previewing the page in different devices.

Click **Save** to preserve your work for future editing, or click **Publish** to make the page live for external viewing. To discard all changes, close or navigate away from the page or component.

## Versioning pages

Page versioning in Experiences is accomplished by making a copy of an existing page to use for revisions. Versioning enables you to revert back to any previous page that is still in the list, or schedule future updates to align with promos, seasonal changes, and other related events.

To make a new version of a page, select the page, mouse over the version you want to duplicate, click the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) to bring up the menu and select **Make a copy**. Update the version name modal box, click the **Save** button, and the new page will appear.

The version naming is your choice. Consistency is best.

* The next serial ascending number such as 1.0, 2.0
* The creation date of the new version such as 1 October 2021
* Title if it relates to something relevant such as Fall specials

When your edits are completed, you can click **Save as draft** to preserve your work for future editing, or click **Publish** to make the page live now for external viewing or schedule it for future publication. If you choose to **Publish** this new version it will go **Live** immediately and change the status of the previously published page to **Ended**.

## Scheduling pages

Versions of pages can be scheduled for publication in the future. This enables advance planning of content updates for events such as Cyber Monday, promotion launches, or seasonal changes. 

Page versions in Draft can be scheduled by clicking the drop-down arrow on **Publish** and selecting **Schedule**. Choose a date and time when this page version should be published in the modal box and click **Save**. 

NOTE_:_ The date-time displayed is based on your specific timezone, using your computer's time setting.

## Depreciating pages

If you want to remove a page from publication but leave it in the list for future publication, you can deactivate it by clicking the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) to bring up the menu to select **Deactivate.**

All previously published pages stay listed until you archive or delete them. Archive pages which you don’t plan to use often or want to have as templates for future projects. If they are not ever going to be published again, you can delete them. Deleting a page is permanent.

To archive or delete a page or a specific version, mouse over it, click vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) to bring up the menu and select **Archive** or **Delete**. To unarchive a page, click the **Archived** selection on the top of the page, mouse over the desired page, click vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) to bring up the menu, and select **Unarchive.**
