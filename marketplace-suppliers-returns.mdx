## Initiate a return

If your retailer partner uses the Marketplace Platform to manage returns, they will create the return in Marketplace and you as the supplier will need to update those returns in the Platform. You can also create a credit memo for returned orders as part of the return management process. If you are unsure how your retailer partner chooses to manage returns, please contact them directly.

Navigate to the **Orders** dashboard by clicking **Orders** from the top navigation menu. From the **Orders** page, use the **More** dropdown menu to the right of the orders search bar and select **Review Returns.**

On the **Returns** page, select the return you wish to process by clicking on the blue ID link.

One the **Return Detail** screen you can **Approve Return** or **Reject Return** by clicking on the corresponding button.

If you approve the return you will then be asked if you would like to create a Credit Memo for that return.

On the **Confirmation** pop-up screen check the box on the top of the screen to **Create a credit memo on approval.** If you choose to create a credit memo enter your credit number and click **Confirm**. If you choose to not create a credit memo, deselect the checkbox and click **Confirm**.

NOTE: Once the return and credit memo has been processed, your retailer partner will have access to the data. If you have specific questions as to how your retailer partner manages returns, please contact them directly.
