#### A dashboard for managing and tracking orders

## Introduction

The Order Management page features a table of all existing orders. To sort the orders in the table, click on the Order ID, Value, or Date column headers. Use the Date, Order Status, Order Line Status, and Channel drop-down menus to filter the data the table shows. The Search bar at the top allows you to find Orders by keyword.

## Order Detail

Click on an order from the table to visit the Order Details page. The Order Details page features a status message at the top to indicate the order’s progress through the steps of the delivery lifecycle: Created, Allocated, Shipped, Delivered, Returned, Cancelled, and Hold. The page also displays the information that the customer entered at the time they placed the order, as well as shipping details.
