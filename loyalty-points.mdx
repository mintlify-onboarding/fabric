## Introduction

Click on **Points** in the left column of Loyalty to manage the points associated with your LMS. The Points section allows you to designate the level of your program that the points apply to and set the duration of points before they expire.

## Points Management

Select **Points Management** under Points in the left column. The main page features an Add points button at the top of the page and a table that shows a list of all existing types of points that you have set up previously.

There are two types of points:

* **Base points** \- points that are earned on regular transactions
* **Bonus points** \- points that are earned on events defined by the promotion builder

**Adding points**

To create a new type of points, select **Base points expiry** or **Bonus points expiry** and then click the **Add points** button. Under Expiry details, fill out the following information:

* Number - the number of points
* Duration - length of time before the points expire, whether year, month, or day
* Entity level - the entity levels you have set up under Hierarchy (e.g. tier, store, etc.)
* Entity - the specific entity you have set up within the entity level you selected above

When you’re finished, click the **Submit** button in the top right.

**Editing Points**

To edit existing points, find the Points you want to edit in Points Management and click the pencil icon at the right and make your changes. Click **Update** to save.

**Deleting Points**

To delete points, find the Points you want to edit in Points Management and click the garbage can icon at the right.

## Transfer Points

To move points between member accounts, click on **Transfer Points** under Member in the left column.

The first row of fields on the Point Transfer Details screen is for the member you would like to transfer points from, and the second row of fields is for the member you would like to transfer points to. Use the Point Type drop-down menu to select whether you are transferring Base Points or Bonus Points, select a Reason Code, and click **Submit** to save your changes.

Points transferred between members retain their original expiration date.
