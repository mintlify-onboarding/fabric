### Overview

Items, which are also referred to as products, are services or stand-alone items sold individually. This document covers the process of adding an individual item to your list of products. You can also add multiple items at the same time by [importing](/docs/products-importing-items) them using a CSV file. 

### Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have set up at least one product attribute group. For more information about creating attribute groups, see [Creating Attribute Groups](/docs/products-settings-creating-attribute-groups).
* Ensure that you have created at least one leaf category to add the item to. For more information about creating categories, see the [Categories section](/docs/products-categories-adding-category).

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > List > Items**.  
The **Items** page is displayed.
2. Click **New Item**.  
The **Select a leaf category** window is displayed. This window displays the root categories and leaf categories that are configured in the Categories page.
3. Select a leaf category.  
Leaf categories are labelled with **leaf**. You must click a root category to view the leaf categories within that category. If a root category has more root categories within it, you might have to continue selecting root categories until you can select a leaf category.
4. Click **Next**.  
The attribute groups you have created and mapped are displayed based on the configuration in the Attributes page.
5. To edit an attribute group, click the **Edit** button next to the attribute group name.  
   * In the **Edit Attributes** window, enter the required details.  
   * Click **Save**.  
   If you want to use more than one attribute group, repeat the above steps for all of those attribute groups.
6. (Optional) If [internationalization](/docs/internationalization) is enabled, from the the language dropdown menu, select the desired language variant for the item.
7. (Optional) Click **Publish**.

The item is now published and moved from draft to active state.
