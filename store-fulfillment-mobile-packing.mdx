## Introduction

Packing items is the second step in the fulfillment process. It involves taking the items that have been picked for a customer’s order and packing them for either shipment or pickup.

It can be done with or without a scanner.

## Packing Items (with scanner)

After pressing the **Pack Fulfillment** button to end the Pick stage, the process advances to the Pack stage and the Parcel Size menu opens. Choose a parcel size and press **Select** to continue. 

The scan window will open automatically. Center the scanning window around the an item's barcode and press the **Capture** button. The ratio at the top of the screen that shows the number of items picked versus the total number of items in the parcel will update automatically.

Use the back button at the top left to cancel scanning and return to the previous screen. 

If you scan too many quantities of a SKU than are included in the order, an error message reading “This item is already complete, scan next item” will appear below the scanning window. 

After all items in the parcel have been scanned, the color of the ratio at the top of the screen will change to green. 

Press the **Done** button at the bottom of the screen to exit scanner mode. 

To re-access the scan window, either press the parcel listing, or press on its ellipses icon to open the Parcel Options menu and select **Scan into parcel**. 

Press the **Ship** button at the bottom of the screen to continue to the next phase of the process. 

## Packing Items (without scanner)

From there, find the parcel you would like to pack and press its corresponding ellipses icon. In the Parcel Options menu that appears, select **Manually add items**.

A list of all items Picked for the order will appear. Enter the SKU for an item and use the plus and minus buttons to adjust the quantity of the item to add. Press **Done** when finished.
