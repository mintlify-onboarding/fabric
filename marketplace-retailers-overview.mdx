> ## ❗️
> 
> Marketplace (Merchants) is now called Marketplace (Retailers)
> 
> Some of fabric's products are undergoing name changes. Marketplace (Merchants) is now Marketplace (Retailers), but you may see the old name in some places as we make the transition.

fabric Marketplace acts as a business catalyst by enabling retailers to curate and offer new product assortments with low risk, low cost and zero added inventory. It is the only dropshipping platform that seamlessly integrates into a business’ commerce stack and allows for rapid expansion and revenue growth while handling all of the complex inventory, transactions, billing, and supplier management functions in the backend.
