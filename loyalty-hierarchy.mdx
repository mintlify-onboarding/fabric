## Introduction

Select the **Hierarchy** menu to set up and manage the structure of your LMS. Hierarchy allows you to design custom levels (e.g. Tier Groups, partners, stores, etc.) that fit your needs and align with your goals.

Every LMS starts out with two levels: the Program and one Tier Group.

Loyalty gives you the freedom to create up to seven additional levels and add tiers within levels so that your LMS can grow and change with your business.

## Program

To begin setting up your Loyalty account, click the **Hierarchy** menu in the left column and select **Program**. The program level controls two fundamental attributes of your LMS:

* Program Name - the name of the program; it’s recommended to make the program name the same as the company name
* Program ID - a unique name to distinguish the program from any Tier Groups or tiers you create

**Note:** Once the Program Details have been set up, they cannot be changed.

## Tier Group

The Tier Group level is where you define most of the attributes for your LMS. To set up the Tier Group level, click Tier Group under Hierarchy in the left column.

Click the **Add Tier Group** button at the top of the page to create a new Tier Group, or click on one of the Tier Groups you’ve created previously to edit it.

**Tier Group Detail**

The Tier Group Detail section has two fields for every Tier Group:

* Tier Group Name - the name of the Tier Group
* Tier Group ID - a unique name you can use to distinguish the Tier Group from any other programs, Tier Group, or tiers you create

In addition, the Tier Group Detail section shows the Rules for the Tier Group, which are created in the Rule Builder.

**Manage Tiers**

Tier Management allows you to define rewards and points for a Tier Group, set the criteria a member must meet in order to qualify for a tier, and write tier rules.

Click the **Add Tier** button to create a new tier, or click on the name of an existing Tier to edit it.

Fill out the following information in the main Tier Management section:

* Tier Name - name of the loyalty system tier (e.g., Black, Silver, Gold)
* External Reference - a unique name you can use to distinguish the tier from any other programs, tier groups, or tiers you create
* Bin Number (optional) - similar to credit and debit cards ability to define the first 4 digits of the loyalty card number (e.g., 8888, 4242)
* Global ranking - the tier’s ranking out of all the tiers you have created across all tier groups
* Local ranking - this specific tier’s ranking out of all the tiers in this specific tier group

The following fields have an associated Expiry Duration Period field that allows you to choose its duration before it expires; whether Year, Month, or Day.

* Tier Expiry Duration - the amount of time the Tier lasts before it ends. If the Tier does not have an end date, check the Infinity checkbox.
* Reward Expiry Duration - the amount of time a member’s rewards will last before they expire
* Base Points Duration - the amount of time points earned on regular transactions last before they expire
* Promotional Points Duration - the amount of time points last when they are earned on events defined by the promotion builder and earned as promotional points
* Bonus Points Duration - the amount of time points last when they are earned on events defined by the promotion builder and earned as bonus points
* Entity Specific Points Duration - the amount of time points last when they are earned on events defined by the promotion builder and earned as entity points (e.g.: points earned at specific entity level in the Hierarchy, like a store or a tier)

Use the Default Tier Upon Enrollment and Paid Tier checkboxes to designate the current tier as entry-level and/or paid. Any tier can be a Paid tier if members need to pay a subscription fee in order to sign up.

**Note:** Payment processing for a paid tier must come from the external application. Loyalty’s API can be used to map the payment, but it does not process the payment.

Click the **Remove** button to delete a tier.

**Core Rules**

Use the Earning Rule fields to define how many points a member earns for each dollar they spend. Use the Redemption Rule fields to set how many points equal $1USD when they’re redeemed.

These rules are automatically imported to any child tiers you create. For example, if you use the Add Level feature to create a store that is a child of a tier you’ve created, it will have the same points earning and redemption rules as defined in the parent tier. See the **Add Level** section for more information.

## Rule Builder

The Rule Builder is a drag-and-drop menu that lets you create “if this, then that” statements to further configure additional rules. Rule attributes are displayed as blocks, each containing different operators and variables. The majority have two things in common: an operator and a variable.

Operators allow for equals to and greater/lesser than statements:

* \== - the value on the left is equal to the value on the right
* != - the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right
* \>= - the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right
* <= - the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right

There are five total rule blocks, each with different variables. Click the Tier rule button to the left of the drag and drop menu to begin using the rule builder.

* And - Joins two rule blocks together. Use the dropdown menu to choose between **and** or **or**. If two rule blocks are joined by **and**, a member must meet the criteria in both statements. If two rule blocks are joined by **or**, a member only has to meet one of them.
* SKU - Enter a SKU and check the duration box and enter a duration in days for a specific time period.
* Transaction Threshold - Enter the minimum and maximum transaction threshold values. Check the infinite box if there is no time limit. Check the duration box and enter a duration in days for a specific time period.
* Points Threshold - Enter the minimum and maximum points thresholds. Check the infinite box if there is no time limit. Check the duration box and enter a duration in days for a specific time period.
* transaction\_count - Enter the minimum threshold value. Check the infinite box if there is no time limit. Check the duration box and enter a duration in days for a specific time period.

To delete a rule block you’ve added, click on it to select it, and then click the trash icon in the bottom right.

**Parent Hierarchy List**

Use the program drop-down menu to select the parent of the tier. When you’re done, click the **Add Parent** button at the right.

**Program Core Rules**

After you select a parent program, its rules will appear in the Program Core Rules. These are a copy of the rules as you set them up at the tier level. You can make adjustments to them here or leave them as-is.

## Product Hierarchy

Product hierarchy allows you to control which products help members earn reward points.

To change the eligibility of a product, click on its name in the Product Hierarchy menu.

Click on the **Is Eligible** field to toggle it between true and false.

The Chain Name, Description, and SKU are static information from the upload process.

The Level Description fields (1 through 4) are all optional fields you can use for additional information.

## Add Hierarchy Level

The Program and Tier Group levels exist as defaults in every Loyalty account. But in many instances, a business may want to create additional levels. For example, a department store could create levels for their men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing departments. Another example could be creating a separate level for each of a local restaurant’s five locations. The Add Level menu allows you to create custom levels that match your business’s structure.

Click **Add Level** to begin.

In the Add Level Entity fields, give the new level a name, and select a set of rules you have created previously at the tier level.

The fields under Add Attributes are custom fields for internal use.

Use the **Add Attribute** and **Remove** buttons to set the number of fields

When you’re finished, click **Submit**. The new level will appear beneath Program and Tier Group in the left-hand column under Hierarchy for further customization.
