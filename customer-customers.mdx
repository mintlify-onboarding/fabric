## Introduction

The Customers page features a table of all existing customers. To sort the customers in the table, click on the Customer name, or Status column headers. Use the Status and Tags drop-down menus to filter the data that the table shows. The Search bar at the top allows you to find customers by name or email. The **Add Customer** button at the very top of the page allows you to create a new customer.

## Adding a Customer

To add a new customer, click the **Add Customer** button at the top of the page. On the Add Customer page, fill out the customer’s name and email address on the Basic information tab.

## Editing a Customer

To edit an existing customer’s information, find and click on their name in the table on the main Customers page.

The individual customer’s profile displays their current information with a button to switch between **Inactive** and **Active**.

Click on the **Edit customer info** button at the top of the page to make changes to their Basic Information and Additional Information.

To add, edit, or remove addresses associated with the customer’s profile, click on **Manage Addresses**. Then select whether you would like to make changes to the customer’s **Shipping Addresses** or **Billing Addresses**. If the customer has any existing addresses, they will appear below. Use the corresponding Edit and Delete buttons to change or remove them. To add another address, click **Add Shipping Address**, fill out the address fields, and then click **Confirm**. When you’re finished with all your changes, click **Save** at the top of the page.
