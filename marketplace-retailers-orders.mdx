## Overview

To navigate to the **Orders** dashboard, login to the Marketplace Platform and click **Orders** on the top menu bar.

The **Orders** dashboard consists of three main sections that make it easy to quickly view all information associated with dropship orders. They are: Open Orders, Reports, and Require Attention.

**Open Orders** \- contains four pre-filtered buckets of dropship orders

* Open Orders - a list of all open orders
* Current Orders - a list of open orders that are within your fulfillment SLA
* Past Fulfillment SLA - a list of open orders that are past your fulfillment SLA
* Late Invoices - a list of open orders that have shipments but remain open due to missing invoices

**Reports** \- contains pre-filtered reports for various order details

* Orders with New Messages - Browse the latest order notes from your partners
* Shipments & Tracking - Review shipments & tracking numbers
* Returns - Track returns and RMA's
* Invoices - Review all invoices from suppliers

**Require Attention** \- contains two pre-filtered buckets to manage cancellations and backorders

* New Cancels - a list of cancellations that require acknowledgement by you, the retailer
* New Backorders - a list of orders that contain item(s) that the supplier has marked as backordered

NOTE: Clicking on any of the pre-filtered buckets within each of the main sections of the Orders dashboard will provide a list view of all orders that fit within the pre-filtered criteria. All data from any page containing a list view of orders can be exported by clicking on the **Export** link on the upper right side of each page. If any additional filters are applied to the page, the export will contain all orders that fit the filter criteria.
