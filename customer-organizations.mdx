## Introduction

The Organizations page shows all previously created organizations in a sortable, filterable table. To sort the organizations, click on the Organization name, Contact Email, or Status column headers. Use the Status drop-down menu to filter the organizations. The Search bar at the top allows you to find organizations by name. The **Add Organization** button at the top of the page allows you to create a new organization.

## Adding an Organization

To add a new organization, click the **Add Organization** button at the top of the page. On the Add Organization page, use the **Active** drop-down menu to set the organization’s status to **Active** or **Inactive** and enter the organization's information in the fields below. At the bottom of the form, use the **Tax Exempt** drop-down menu to set the organization’s tax exempt status. When set to **Yes**, three new required fields appear: Tax ID, Tax Exempt Start Date, and Tax Exempt End Date.

When you’re finished creating the organization, click **Save** at the top of the page.

## Editing an Organization

To edit an existing organization’s information, find and click on its name in the table on the main Organizations page.

* **Details:** The organization’s basic information. Click Edit at the top of the page to make changes, and click Save when finished.
* **Addresses:** All of the organization’s associated addresses. Click on Add Address to add a new address, or click on an existing address to edit it. Click save when finished.

* **Groups:** All groups of users at the organization. Click on Add Group to add a new group, or click on an existing group to edit it. Click save when finished.
