## Orders

The Fulfillments main screen shows all existing orders, divided into in four categories accessible from the left navigation:

* **Pending Orders:** Orders that are newly created, orders for which host processing has not yet begun, or orders that are in the processing stage.
* **Rejected Orders:** Rejected or canceled orders.
* **Completed Orders:** Orders that have been completed.
* **All Orders**

Selecting a category loads the orders in that category into the list view at the right. Information about each order is organized into columns.

* **Order #:** The order’s identifying number
* **Order size:** The number of items in the order
* **Tags:** Indicate orders with special instructions (value-added service options like installation or giftwrapping)
* **Customer:** The customer’s name
* **Shipping Type:** Will display one of the following:  
   * The name of the shipping courier for traditional ship-to orders  
   * **Curbside** for curbside pickup  
   * **Pickup** for buy online pickup in-store (BOPIS)
* **Ship By:** The date the order must be fulfilled

### Search, filter, and refresh

Find a specific order in the list view by using the search, filter, and refresh features. 

To search for an order, type key words into the search bar and hit enter. The list view will display any matching results. 

The filter icon is to the right of the search bar. Click it to open the Filter dropdown menu. You can filter by the date the order ships, the order’s status, and special handling instructions. After you’ve set up the filter settings, click **Apply Filters** to view results. 

Click the refresh icon at the far right to reload the list view with any changes to orders that may have occurred since the list was last loaded.

## Items

The Items tab serves as a batch picking mechanism to pick outstanding items to fulfill multiple pending orders. The Items tab displays all items in a store that are required to fulfill the store’s pending orders. Information about each outstanding item is organized into the following columns:

* **Item Name:** The name of the item
* **Quantity:** The number of items pending fulfillment, displayed in fraction form. The numerator represents the number of items that have been scanned and picked, and the denominator represents the total number of items to be scanned and packed.
* **SKU:** The item’s SKU number
* **Color:** The item color
* **Size:** The item size

### Filter and refresh

The Filter button can be used to sort the outstanding items to be fulfilled. You can filter by the date the order must be shipped, the order’s status (in progress, overdue, and assigned to me), and special handling instructions. After you’ve selected your filters, click **Apply Filters** to view results. For example, if you’re looking to pick all the items for orders that have been assigned to you, you can select and apply the “Assigned to Me” status and batch pick all items at once.

Click the refresh icon at the far right to reload the list view with any changes to orders that may have occurred since the list was last loaded. 

### Scan in Items

Select **Scan in Items** to begin batch picking items. Once items are scanned for picking, the quantity tags in each order’s tile will update, displaying the number of picked items over the number of total items for an order.

When all items in a filter have already been scanned for picking, clicking the Scan in Items button will indicate that there are no items available to pick.
