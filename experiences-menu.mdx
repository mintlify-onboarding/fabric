## Menu nodes

Experiences users can employ parent and child categories to create multiple navigation paths and multichannel offerings using a configurable hierarchical structure.

Clicking on the **Department** menu item will reveal submenus (nodes) in the same hierarchy that will appear on the finished webpage. **Department** represents the main menu selections or top-most navigation elements. Each section to the right will appear as you mouseover or click on the main menu selection on the completed page.

## Node edit options

Mousing over a node activates the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) with a menu of available operations.

* Rename - edit the node name
* Edit item - modify the parameters, attributes and images related to that node
* Delete - remove the node permanently
* Enable - make the node visible on the webpage

## Modifying node parameters

To edit node parameters, mouseover the node, click on the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) to bring up the menu and select **Manage node.** The modal box will contain the parameters to be modified.

* Enable or disable the menu item using the toggle in the upper right
* Change the node name by entering it in **Item name** field
* Declare the subdirectory URL by entering it into the **URL path** field
* Add attributes for searching and other functions by adding the info in the **Enter parameter** and **Enter value** fields
