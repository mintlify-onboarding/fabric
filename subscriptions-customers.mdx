## Introduction

Customers shows a list of everyone who has purchased a recurring order. It displays the customer’s email address and all of their Active, Paused, and Cancelled subscriptions. At the top of the page, there is an **Export** button to download all customers as a **CSV file** and a search bar to find customers.

Click on a **Customer** from the list to load the details screen, where you’ll find all of that customer’s subscriptions, along with the Ship Type, Status, and Payment due date for each. Clicking on a subscription takes you to the Order Details screen to make edits.

The Activity Log button at the top of the screen shows additional details on each of the customer’s orders. Like clicking on an order in the customer details screen, clicking on an order in the Activity Log also takes you to the Order Details screen to make edits.
