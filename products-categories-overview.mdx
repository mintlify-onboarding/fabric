### Overview

Categories define the structure of item lists in Products. Categories can be organized into a hierarchical tree structure based on common attributes, allowing logical grouping of items. 

Every item on your product list must belong to one category or subcategory. There is no limit to the number of categories or subcategories.

Categories and subcategories can be best explained with the tree analogy. For instance, if a furniture company has "furniture" as the main category or "root," the branches would be subcategories like "tables" and "chairs," and the leaves would represent individual products, like an oak dining table that seats 4\. Visually, that would look something like this:

>         * Leaf: Coffee Tables  
>                  * Product: Oak coffee table  
>                  * Product: Oak coffee table, glass top  
>   * Branch: Chairs  
>         * Leaf: Dining Chairs  
>                  * Product: Oak dining chair  
>                  * Product: Oak dining chair, with arms  
>         * Leaf: Office Chairs  
>                  * Product: Computer chair  
>                  * Product: Computer chair, reclining

Any attribute applied to a category is inherited by its subcategories. This is known as attribute inheritance. However, inherited attributes can be overwritten by assigning the attribute to the subcategory itself. For example, the broad "office chairs" category could have a "material" attribute set to leather, but a specific subcategory could be set to nylon.
