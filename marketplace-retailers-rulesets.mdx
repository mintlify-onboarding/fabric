## Overview

A ruleset is a set of conditions that can be applied to a proposal through the feature called Proposal Departments. A ruleset consists of multiple rule groups. Each rule group can have multiple rules configured where each rule dictates the conditions for an individual attribute.

* Retailers and suppliers use rulesets to dictate the terms of a proposal department
* Rules set under a ruleset are applied to all items and attributes during a proposal
* Proposal compatibility will check all the items from the template and apply the rulesets on them. Only validated items will be added to the proposal
* Every retailer must have at least 2 rulesets, one to be used as Retailer ruleset and one to be used as suppliers ruleset. Refer to [Proposal Departments](/docs/marketplace-retailers-proposal-departments) for more details.

To configure a Rule Group in a Ruleset, click on the **Ruleset Name** you created.

Click on Create inside the **Rule Group** section and complete the dialog box

* **Name** \- Name of the Rule Group. This represents the group to which the attribute belongs. For example, all identifier-related attribute rules can be part of the a single group called Identification.

A validator Enables retailers to set more complex validations on their attributes.

Once a rule is added, validators can be added to it.

To add a validator, click **Add** next to the rule inside the list.

Select the validation **Type** from the dropdown menu.

Enter the relevant expression in **Value.**
