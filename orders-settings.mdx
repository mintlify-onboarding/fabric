## Attributes

The Attributes menu lets you create a range of custom attributes that can be applied to Orders, Invoices, Locations, Networks, and more. For example, you could create a custom attribute that would allow customers to select gift wrapping at checkout. 

To navigate to the Attributes page, click on Settings in the left menu and then select **Attributes**. 

The Attributes page shows a list of all Attributes you have created previously. You can edit or delete a previously created Attribute by hovering over its name in the list and clicking the pencil icon or trash can icon at the right.

To create a new attribute, click the **Create Attribute** button at the top-right. 

On the Create Attribute page, fill out the following information: 

* Attribute name: give the attribute a name
* Mandatory attribute: use the checkbox to choose whether or not the attribute is mandatory
* Select the Data type:  
   * Boolean for attributes with yes/no or true/false options  
   * String for an attribute that will contain characters like a message for gift wrapping  
   * Double for a pair of fields with a minimum and maximum value
* Description (Optional): enter a short description for the attribute.
* Section: choose where to add the attribute within the order process:  
   * Location  
   * Order  
   * Network  
   * Inventory  
   * Shipment  
   * Allocation  
   * Invoice

Depending on the selection you made in the Data type dropdown, you will have additional fields to configure. 

Enter a value in the Default value field, or leave it set to “false” for no default value.

## Shipment Methods

The **Shipment Methods** menu has options to set up details like shipping costs, duration, freight options, and restrictions.

To add Shipping information, first click on Settings in the left menu and then select **Shipment Methods**. On the Shipping and carriers page, click **Add Shipping** and fill out the following sections:

**Basic Information**

* Carrier name
* Shipment cost: the shipping cost you charge the customer
* Shipping description (optional): e.g.; "Guaranteed delivery by 9PM tomorrow"
* Channel: US Web or CA Web
* Shipment tax code: the code provided by your tax service

**Carrier SLA**

* Minimum days to deliver

**Freight options & Restrictions**

* Minimum and maximum fields for an item’s weight, length, width, and height

**Product Selection**

Choose whether the Shipping and carrier rules apply to specific products only, or to a purchase’s entire cart value.

* To specific products: use the Add Products button to select eligible products
* Cart Value: enter a minimum and maximum cart value

When you’re finished configuring the Add Shipping and Carrier attributes, click **Save** at the top-right of the page.

## Backorder & Preorder

The Backorder & Preorder menu allows you to configure settings for backorders and preorders. 

Backorders are defined as orders for products that are not currently available for fulfillment, while preorders are for products that are not yet released. 

To navigate to the Backorder & Preorder page, click on Settings in the left menu and then select **Backorder & Preorder**. 

**Backorders**

To allow backorders, click the **Allow Backorders** toggle. Once backorders are turned on, new options and fields appear below.

Use the **Consent to delay should start** options to choose whether the customer’s consent to order a backordered item begins on the date the order was created or on the ship by date. 

The following four fields allow you to control what happens if an order is backordered. For each field, enter a number or use the plus/minus buttons to adjust the number of days allowed.

* In the first field, set the number of days past the promised order date/ship-by date before sending the first consent-to-delay notification to the customer.
* In the second field, set the number of days past the promised order date/ship-by date before sending the second consent-to-delay notification to the customer.
* In the third field, set the number of days to cancel the order if the customer does not respond to either of the first two notifications.
* In the fourth field, set the number of days to cancel a backordered order, even if the customer had previously agreed to a consent-to-delay notification.

**Preorders**

To allow preorders, click the **Allow Preorders** toggle.

## Policies

The Policies menu allows you to define how your business process things like returns, cancellations, and exchanges. 

To navigate to the Policies page, click on Settings in the left menu and then select **Policies**. 

The Policies page shows a list of all Policies you have created previously. You can edit or delete a previously created Policy by hovering over its name in the list and clicking the pencil icon or trash can icon at the right. 

To create a new policy, click the **Create Policy** button at the top-right of the page. 

In the Basic Information section on the Create Policy page, fill out a name for the policy. 

Use the Policy Type dropdown to choose the kind of policy this is, whether **Return**, **Cancellation**, or **Exchange**. 

Use the channel dropdown to choose either **12** (USA Web) or **13** (Canada Web).

**Return, Cancellation, or Exchange**

Depending on the selection you made in the Policy Type dropdown above, the name of this section will change. However, the three fields it contains remain the same. 

Use the +/- buttons or enter numbers in the **Days**, **Hours**, and **Minutes** fields to adjust how long customers have to return, cancel, or exchange an item. 

**Refund Fee**

The Refund Fee section allows you to set up things like restocking or repackaging fees. 

Use the Currency dropdown to set the currency, and then enter a short description in the Fee type field and an amount in the Return fee field. 

Click the **Add** button to add another type of fee. 

**Reason Codes**

The Reason Codes section allows you to create predefined reasons as to why the customer is returning their order (e.g. didn’t fit, wrong color, changed mind, etc.). Click the **Add reason code** button to add a reason code and enter a description (optional). Click **Save** when finished.
