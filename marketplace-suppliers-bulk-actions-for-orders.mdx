## Introduction

With the Bulk Actions features in Marketplace, you can easily perform actions that affect multiple orders.

This document is divided into two sections: **Open Orders** and **Canceled Orders and Backorders**.

## Open Orders

This section outlines the steps to perform bulk actions on open orders, including printing pick tickets, reprinting shipping labels, reprinting packing slips, and manually accepting orders.

To begin, navigate to the **Orders** page in Marketplace, and click on one of the tiles under **Open Orders**.

On the Orders page, find the order(s) you would like to print a pick ticket for and click the corresponding checkbox(es) at the left to select them.

After you select the Orders, click the **Actions** dropdown and take the following steps based on the action you need to perform.

### Print Pick Ticket

The pick ticket differs from a packing slip. A packing slip is required for all Retailer orders and contains all of your required information. A pick ticket provides a “pick list” of the order line information with your supplier SKU information and total ordered quantity. This can be helpful if your Retailer uses a retailer SKU on the packing slip instead of your internal supplier SKU.

Select **Print Pick Tickets** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will be able to download and/or print your pick ticket(s).

### Reprint Shipping Labels

If shipping labels are being generated directly in fabric Marketplace, you can reprint them at any time.

Select **Print Shipping Labels** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will be able to download and/or print your shipping label(s).

### Reprint Packing Slips

To reprint a packing slip for a specific order or batch of orders, select **Print Packing Slips** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will be able to download and/or print packing slip(s).

### Manually Accepting (Acknowledging) Orders

To accept (also called acknowledge) an order or a set of orders, select **Accept Orders** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will see an overview of the order(s) you selected. Click **Accept All Orders** to confirm. 

Once the order(s) have been accepted, the status will change from **Ready** to **OK**.

## Canceled Orders and Backorders

This section outlines the steps to perform bulk actions on orders that require attention, including canceled and backordered orders.

### Manually Accepting (Acknowledging) Canceled Orders

When orders are canceled by a Supplier, Retailers have the ability to acknowledge the cancelation. If you do not have an automated integration with the fabric Marketplace Platform, you can acknowledge canceled orders manually within the platform. 

Navigate to the **Orders** page and click **New Cancels** in the **Requires Action** section of the **Orders** dashboard.

In the list of canceled orders, **click the checkbox** beside the canceled order you would like to acknowledge.

Click the **Actions** dropdown at the top of the list and select **Acknowledge Cancels**.

Click the **Acknowledge All Cancels** in the popup window to complete the process. 

### Managing orders with backordered Items

When items in an order are marked as backordered by a Supplier, Retailers have the ability to acknowledge the backorder. If you do not have an automated integration with the fabric Marketplace Platform, you can acknowledge orders with backordered items directly within the platform. 

Navigate to the **Orders** page and click **New Backorders** in the **Requires Action** section of the **Orders** dashboard.

In the list of backorders, click the **blue PO# link** to open the order detail page.

On the order detail page you can view the date the supplier expects the item to be back in stock in the **Key Dates** section.

You can then acknowledge the backorder by clicking the **Acknowledge Backorder** button at the top of the page.
