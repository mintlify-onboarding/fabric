## Introduction

The Retailer menu lets suppliers view a list of all connected retailer partners and details about each, as well as make edits to the connection settings that affect transaction and business practices with each retailer. 

To view the Retailer page, click **Retailers** from the menu across the top of the page in Marketplace. 

The Retailer page features a searchable, filterable table that displays basic information about each retailer.

* **ID:** The connection ID. A unique value that the system assigns each specific Supplier - Retailer connection.
* **Retailer:** Name of the retailer.
* **Supplier #:** Your supplier number in the context of the connection.
* **orders (Last 7):** The total number of orders you’ve received from the retailer partner in the last seven days.
* **Integration:** The type of integration between the Retailer partner’s system and their fabric Marketplace portal.
* **Status:** Status of the connection in real time.

Clicking on a retailer’s name opens the Retailer Detail page.

## Retailer Details Page

The Retailer Detail page shows information about the retailer, broken up in to four menus available at the left-hand side of the page: **Summary**, **Locations**, **Attributes**, and **Carriers**.

### Summary

Summary is the default view of the Retailer Detail menu. There are five sections: Connection Detail, Payment Settings, SLAs, Contacts, Settings, Connection Notes, and Invoice Adjustments.

#### Connection Detail

The Connection Detail section displays the following information:

* **Retailer:** The retailer’s name
* **Retailer #:** The retailer’s number
* **Retailer ID:** The retailer’s ID
* **Integration Type:** The integration type the retailer used
* **Catalog Import Method:** The method of catalog sharing you used to for this specific retailer
* **Welcome Call Date:** The date the retailer had their scheduled welcome call with fabric Marketplace
* **Packing Slip Template:** The type of packing slip the retailer uses to fulfill the supplier’s orders

#### Payment Settings

The Payment Settings section displays the following information:

* **Cost Tracking:** the cost method the retailer is using for this specific connection
* **Payment Terms:** The payment terms the retailer follows for the Purchase Orders you fulfill. There are five payment terms available: Net 15 Days, Net 30 Days, Net 45 Days, Net 60 Days, and Net 90 Days.

#### SLAs

The SLAs section shows the number of days you have to fulfill any order you receive so that you meet the SLA criteria.

#### Contacts

The Contacts section displays the following information:

* **Primary:** The primary point of contact at the retailer’s business
* **Merchandising:** The merchandising point of contact at the retailer’s business
* **Fulfillment:** The fulfillment point of contact at the retailer’s business

#### Settings

The information in the Settings section is set by your retailer partner. 

* **Ship from Retailer:** If the supplier generates Shipping Labels from fabric Marketplace, enabling this option will populate the "ship from" on all shipping labels with a merchant return address. Some carriers might not respect this address, so it should be viewed as cosmetic only.
* **Auto-populate Invoice Data:** If enabled, all the invoices will be generated automatically as soon as the order is fulfilled. Only the invoice number will be left blank. Enabling this feature may reduce invoicing discrepancies, but suppliers will not be able to submit custom adjustments.
* **Require Pricing Approval On Proposals?:** If the retailer/supplier connection is using Proposals as the Catalog Import Method, enabling this option will require the extra step of approving Pricing before the proposal is accepted.
* **Include 850 In Packing Slip?:** If the supplier has an EDI integration in place, enabling this option will include the packing slip in the EDI 850 document.
* **Auto Invoice And Close Order When Fulfilled:** If this option is enabled, as soon as an order is fully shipped, the invoice is automatically generated and the order is closed. This is different from “Auto-populate Invoice Data,” which does not close the order. This option overrides the settings done for “Auto-populate Invoice Data.”

#### Connection Notes

The Connection Notes section keeps any notes left by fabric Staff and retailers to store critical information or decision taken while onboarding or during business with the retailer. 

The visibility of these notes can be set by the retailer based on the business requirements. As the supplier, you can only view the notes you have permission to see.

#### Invoice Adjustments

The Invoice Adjustments section stores the default adjustments set for the particular connection with your retailer partner.

As a supplier, you may need various adjustments on the invoices, such as shipping fees, service fess, or other types of charges incurred while fulfilling the order. 

You may also have to pay certain charges on your retailer partner such as return allowances, damages etc.

To edit these settings, contact your retailer partner.

### Attributes

To visit the **Attributes** menu, select Attributes from the navigation at the left of the Retailer Detail page. You will be able to see any attributes your retailer partner might have stored related to their connection with you.

### Carriers

The Carriers menu is where the retailer designates the Shipping Accounts the supplier is able to use. To visit the Carriers menu, select **Carriers** from the navigation at the left of the Supplier Detail page.

Retailers can approve any number of Shipping Accounts to be used by you as their supplier. Once approved, you will be able to ship an order using your Shipping Accounts.

If you don’t have any carriers listed here, [you might need to set up your own carriers](/docs/marketplace-suppliers-settings#shipping-accounts).
