## Introduction

To import products from Shopify, click on Products in the menu across the top of Marketplace.

On the Products dashboard, scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Import from Shopify** to begin pulling in your products. 

Choose the products you would like to import:

* **Import products from a Shopify collection (recommended).** This method requires that you have products in a Shopify collection. You will be prompted to enter the name of the Collection in the search bar (it must match the name of your collection in Shopify).
* **Import all products that are currently published to my online store.**

Click **Continue** to begin importing. 

Once products have been imported from Shopify, they will be available from the Product Dashboard. Depending on your retailer partner's product requirements, you may be asked to submit a proposal for these items.
