fabric customer allows you to manage information for the customers and organizations you do business with, including the contracts you may have with them.

## Prerequisites

Copilot is the primary interface for working with fabric applications. You will need an active account, including an account ID, to access Copilot. Contact your Copilot Admin or Customer Success representative to obtain these credentials.

## Launching Customer

After logging in to Copilot, select **Customer** from the header across the top of the page to access the **Member Dashboard**. 

## Navigation

Customer is divided into three separate sections accessible from the left column:

* [Quickstart](/docs/customer-quickstart) \- basic instructions to configure Customer for initial use
* [Customers](/docs/customer-customers) \- manage business-to-consumer (B2C) customers
* [Organizations](/docs/customer-organizations) \- manage business-to-business (B2B) customers
* [Contacts](/docs/customer-contracts) \- manage business-to-business pricing agreements

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

fabric Copilot provides the ability to restrict the access of different users to information and actions available to them through roles. For more information and instructions on how to set up these controls, [visit the RBAC documentation](/docs/role-based-access-control).
