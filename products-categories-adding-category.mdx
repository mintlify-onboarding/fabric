### Overview

Categories are hierarchical tree structures that allow you to organize items, variants, and bundles into groups based on similar attributes. This document covers how to create a single category using the Copilot interface. You can also add multiple categories at the same time by [importing them](/docs/products-categories-importing-categories) using a CSV file.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have access to the Products service in Copilot. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/docs/role-based-access-control).

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Categories**.  
The Categories page is displayed.
2. Click the **+** icon.
3. Enter a title for the new category and press **Enter**.  
The new category is created.
4. (Optional) Click the new category name and then click the **+** icon at the right to create a new subcategory.  
The new subcategory is created.

When you click a root category, all subcategories within the root category are displayed at the right. A **leaf** label is used to indicate any category or subcategory that does not contain a subcategory.
