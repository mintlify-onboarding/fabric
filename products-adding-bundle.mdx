### Overview

Bundles are two or more products sold together. Creating a bundle allows you to group products that are exclusively sold together or group products that can be purchased together and separately.

This document covers the process of adding a single bundle. To add multiple bundles at the same time, see Import Bundles.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have: 

* Set up at least one product attribute group. For more information about creating categories, see the [Categories section](/docs/products-categories-adding-category).
* Created at least one leaf category to add the bundle to. For more information about creating categories, see the [Categories section](/docs/products-categories-adding-category).
* Created at least two items. For more information about creating items, see [Adding an Item](/docs/products-adding-item) or [Importing Items](/docs/products-importing-items).

Leaf categories are labeled **leaf**. You must click a root category to view the leaf categories within that category. If a root category has more root categories within it, you might have to continue selecting root categories until you can select a leaf category.
