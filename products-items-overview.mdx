title: "Items Overview"

An item is a standalone service or product sold individually. You can create items manually or import items and the details using a CSV file. Each item can have different variations, known as variants, distinguished by specific differences from the standard version. 

For example, in a furniture store, a dining table might have variations in sizes, such as round or rectangular and finishes, such as oak, mahogany, or walnut, resulting in unique versions. 

While configuring items, you can use validations to ensure data consistency and quality for each item.
