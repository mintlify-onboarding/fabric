> Some of fabric's products are undergoing name changes. Marketplace (Merchants) is now Marketplace (Retailers), but you may see the old name in some places as we make the transition.

## Initial Setup

To access Integrations, click on your account name in the menu at the top of the page. In the dropdown that appears, select **Retailer Settings**. On the Retailer Settings page, find and click on the **Integrations** tile. 

On the Integrations page, click on the **Add Integration** button at the top-right of the page. In the Add Integration popup that appears, click the **Add** button on the ShipStation tile.

You will be prompted to fill out your ShipStation **API Key** and **API Secret**. When finished, click the **Add Integration** button.

After successful authorization, ShipStation will appear in your list of integrations in Marketplace.

If you don't have your ShipStation credentials, [use their guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025856212-ShipStation-API) to learn how to generate your API Key and Secret. 

## Configuration

On the Integrations page, find and click on the **Options** button to the right of the ShipStation logo and select **Configuration** from the dropdown. The Configuration page allows you to make changes related to how order and transaction information is shared between Marketplace and ShipStation.

### Orders

Marketplace can send orders directly to your ShipStation account so that you can view all your orders in one place. Enabling this option allows you to fulfill orders from ShipStation while fabric captures the fulfillment details every time an order is fulfilled.

Click the **Enable Integration** button to turn on the Push Orders to ShipStation feature.

Click **Disable Integration** to turn off Push Orders to ShipStation feature.

**Please note:** the Push Orders to ShipStation feature affects all of your retail partners; it **cannot** be configured to each individual partner.

### Fulfillments

Configure how ShipStation syncs fulfillments with fabric.

When tracking numbers are added to your fulfillments, you have the option to automatically return the tracking numbers to your Retailer partner.

Click the **Enable Integration** button to turn on the Pull Shipments from ShipStation feature.

Once you’ve made a selection click **Enable Integration**.

To disable fulfillment sync, click the **Disable Integration** button.

## Webhook History

Select **Webhook History** from the **Options** dropdown on the Integration page.

The Webhook History page shows details of all the events that have been captured by Marketplace from ShipStation:

* ID: The ID of the webhook as captured by Marketplace. This ID is generated by Marketplace.
* Topic: The topic that was captured as part of the webhook.
* Received: The timestamp of when the webhook was captured, shown in the user’s local time zone.
* Has Message?: A checkmark will indicate whether or not the webhook came with an additional message, such as the reason of failure or skipping.
* Status: The status of the webhook in Marketplace.

### Inspect Webhook

Click on a webhook ID to open the Inspect Webhook dialog. Inspect Webhook shows information captured in the webhook and includes a message to provide details on the status of the webhook.
