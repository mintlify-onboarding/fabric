## Overview

A proposal is a list of items submitted by a supplier to a retailer partner directly in the Marketplace Platform. 

When a proposal is submitted by one of your connected suppliers, you will receive an email notification that a new list of items has been submitted. You can then review the items on that proposal prior to accepting and approving. 

## Proposal types

There are two types of proposals that can be submitted by suppliers

* New item proposals - these proposals will contain new items that are not currently available on your site.
* Cost update proposals - these proposals will contain existing items that have already been approved but require a change to the agreed upon wholesale cost.

Both proposals will be reviewed and approved with the same process outlined below. 

## Managing proposals

To manage both new item proposals and cost update proposals, navigate to the **Products** page and select **Proposals**, located in the **Curate** section of the **Products** page.

On the **Assortment Proposals** page, select **Proposed**to pull up a list of all recently submitted proposals.

The **Proposal** page will contain a list of all submitted proposals that have yet to be actioned. 

To review a proposal from the list, click the blue link in the proposal **ID** column to access the **Proposal Detail** page.

Using the **Proposal Menu** on the **Proposal Detail** page you can review the items on the proposal at both the product level or the item level.

Once items have been reviewed and you would like to approve the items, return to the summary screen using the proposal menu and click **Approve.**

Once the proposal is approved, it will move to the **Ready to Publish** section on the **Assortment Proposals** page.

Click on the **Ready to Publish** section to pull up a list of approved proposals that contain the items that are ready to be published on your site. 

To pull up a proposal from the list, click the blue link in the proposal **ID** column to access the **Proposal Detail** page.

On the **Proposal Detail** page, you can now export the list of items on the proposal and prepare new items to be published on your site or cost changes to be made.

To complete the process and remove the proposal from the **Ready to Publish** section, click **Acknowledge.**

Acknowledging the proposal will move the proposal to the **Completed** section on the main **Proposals** page. 

Once the items from the proposal are added to your site you can begin receiving orders for those items.
