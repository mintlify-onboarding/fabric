### Prerequisites

You will need an active account, including an account ID, to access Copilot. Contact your Copilot system administrator or Customer Success Representative to obtain these credentials.

### Authentication

Users must be invited to Copilot by a system administrator. Once invited, they will receive an email containing a link to Copilot and their account ID. On first log in, the user will set their password. Subsequent logins will require the Account ID, user email, and password for credentials.
