To the right of the Add Webhook button, thereâ€™s a list of previously created webhooks. Mouse over a webhook and click on the **View** button to make changes in the Add Webhooks modal.

Click on **Notification & Dunning** to control when events are triggered in the system. Mouse over the list of notifications at the right and click on the **Edit** button to make changes. Set events to trigger a few days earlier so that customers can be informed ahead of time.

Choose **Custom Attributes** to send additional information about a plan to your storefront. Click on the **Add New** button to create a new attribute. From the **Add New** page:

* Select an attribute from the Attribute type drop-down menu

Once the custom fields are created, they can be added to new or existing plans from the Plan Manager.
