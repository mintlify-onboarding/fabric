### Overview

Categories are hierarchical tree structures that allow you to organize items, variants, and bundles into groups based on similar attributes. This document covers the process of importing multiple categories using a CSV file. You can also [add categories individually](/docs/products-categories-adding-category).

#### CSV File Guidelines

You can import categories using CSV files only, fabric does not support any other data or file formats. Here are the key points to consider:

* The headers, represented in the first row of the CSV file, should match the attributes of the category.
* While category titles are not case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original category titles is recommended.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.
* We recommend that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your own CSV file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

#### Category Data Formatting

When preparing your CSV file for import, ensure that the category data format aligns with the column requirements. Different columns have specific data input requirements:

* **Action**: Accepts one of the following commands:  
   * **Create** adds a new category.  
   * **Update** replaces the details of an existing category.  
   * **Upsert** creates a new category or replaces the details of an existing category.  
   Note that if no action is specified for a row, upsert is considered the default.  
   * **Delete** removes an existing category.
* **Node ID**: Represents the Category ID.  
   * When creating a category, this field must be left blank; otherwise, you will receive an error.  
   * When updating, upserting, or deleting a category, enter the Node ID or Node Name.
* **Parent Category**: Unless you are creating a primary or root category, specify the parent for the new category you want to create or update.
* **Node Name**: Name of the root, branch, or leaf categories that you are creating or updating.
* **Order**: The order in which a given category must appear among sibling categories. If multiple categories are assigned the same order, the newly added categories appear in alphabetical order.
* **Product Attributes**: Attributes of products associated with a category.
* **Category Attributes**: Attributes of a category.
