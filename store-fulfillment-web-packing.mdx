## Introduction

Packing items is the second step in the fulfillment process. It involves taking the items that have been picked for a customer’s order and packing them for either shipment or pickup.

It can be done with or without a scanner. 

## Packing Items (with scanner)

Select a parcel to begin packing items, and a **Scan to pack items** popup will appear. 

Scan each item in the order. 

Once all the items are scanned, their quantity tags turn green. Click the **Done** button at the bottom of the popup to save the changes and add them to the parcel.

## Packing Items (without scanner)

After all items in the order have been picked, the **Pack** button at the bottom of the page becomes enabled. Click it to begin packing the order. 

The **Parcel Size** popup opens with a list of available parcels along with their dimensions. Choose a parcel and click **Select** to continue or **Cancel** to exit.

Upon clicking Select, a notification appears at the top of the page letting you know the parcel has been added. In addition, the Parcel Size popup closes and the **Scan to pack items** popup opens. 

In the packing stage, two new options are added to the dropdown that’s accessed by clicking on the ellipses button at the top-right: **Add Parcel** and **Start over**. **Note:** The options in this dropdown stay the same throughout the Pick, Pack, and Ship process, but depending on the step in the process, some options are disabled.

**Print pick list:** Print the list of items as a PDF

Click **Add parcel** and the **Parcel Size popup** reopens. Choose a parcel and click **Select** to continue or **Cancel** to exit. 

Click **Start over** and the **Do you want to start over?** popup appears. Click **Yes, delete all & start over** to unpack all items and unselect any parcels. Click **Cancel** to exit the popup.

### Parcels Menu

The Parcels section contains all of the parcels you have added to an order. 

Click the ellipses at the top-right of a parcel to open the parcel options. 

* **Scan into parcel** opens the same **Scan to pack items** popup that is accessible by simply clicking on the parcel.
* **Manually add items** opens a popup with all items picked for the order with corresponding counters that allowing for manual adding and subtracting from the parcel. Click **Done** to save or **Cancel** to exit.

Select **Clear parcel content** to remove all items added to the parcel. The **Do you want to proceed?** popup appears. Click **Yes, clear contents** to continue or **Cancel** to exit. 

Select **Change parcel type/size** to reopen the **Parcel Size popup**. Choose a parcel and then click **Select** to continue or **Cancel** to exit. 

Choose **Remove parcel** to delete the parcel and all of the items added to it. The **Do you want to proceed?** popup will appear. Click **Yes, remove parcel** to continue or **Cancel** to exit.

Click on the **Click to scan items into parcel** link within a parcel and the **Scan to pack items** popup will appear.
