## Introduction

Users are the people who have access to your Loyalty account. The Users section in fabric is where the administrator of the account can manage roles and permissions.

Click on Users in the left column and select User Management to see a list of all existing users.

## Adding a User

Click the Add User button at the top of the page to create a profile for a new user. Enter their **User Information** and click the **Submit** button at the top-right of the page.

**Viewing/editing a User**

From User Management, find the member whose information you would like to view or edit. Click on the eye icon to view their information, or the pencil icon to edit it. After editing a user’s information, click the blue Update button in the top-right to save your changes.

## View Role

Click **View Role** under Users in the left column to see a list of all of the user roles and their capabilities. View Role is a reference page; there are no controls or features.

## Role Settings

Click **Role Settings** under Users in the left column to control the number of adjustments and the number of points a specific type of user role is permitted. Not every capability listed in View Role is modifiable, but Role Settings does allow the account owner to limit the number and amount of adjustments to prevent overuse.

From the **Select User** drop-down menu, choose the user role you would like to manage. Enter values in the fields you would like to control, and then click the blue Submit button at the top-right of the page to save your changes.
