> Some of fabric's products are undergoing name changes. Member is becoming Loyalty, but you may see the old name in some places as we make the transition.

Loyalty allows you to create hierarchies, add partners, manage member accounts, and integrate with various web and mobile applications with fabric’s headless commerce API.

## Prerequisites

Copilot is the primary interface for working with Fabric applications. You will need an active account, including an account ID, to access Copilot. Contact your Copilot Admin or Customer Success representative to obtain these credentials.

## Navigation

Loyalty is divided into seven separate sections accessible from the left menu selections
