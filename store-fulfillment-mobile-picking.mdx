## Introduction

Picking items is the first step in the fulfillment process. It involves selecting the items in a customer’s order to prepare them to be packed.

It can be done with or without a scanner.

## Picking Items (with scanner)

Press the **Scan** button at the bottom of the screen to begin fulfilling the order by picking and scanning in the items the customer has purchased. 

Center the scanning window around an item's barcode and press the **Capture** button to scan it. The ratio at the top of the screen that shows the number of items picked versus the total number of items in the order will update automatically and turn green when all items have been picked.

Use the back button at the top left to cancel scanning and return to the previous screen. 

If you scan too many quantities of a SKU than are included in the order, an error message reading “This item is already complete, scan next item” will appear below the scanning window. 

After all items in the order have been scanned, the color of the ratio at the top of the screen will change to green. 

Press the **Done** button at the bottom of the screen to exit scanner mode. 

Press the **Pack Fulfillment** button at the bottom of the screen to continue to the next phase of the process.

## Picking Items (without scanner)

Select an order from the Fulfillments main screen to open the Pick Stage. 

Use the back button at the top left to cancel scanning and return to the previous screen. 

Click the ellipses at the top right to open the Order Options menu. **Note:** The options in this menu stay the same throughout the Pick, Pack, and Ship process, but depending on the step in the process, some options are disabled. 

* **Print pick list:** Print the list of items as a PDF
* **Reject order:** Select Reject Order and the **Reject Fulfillment** popup will open. To reject the order, use the field at the top to confirm the order number and then use the Reason dropdown to select a reason. Click **Reject Order** to proceed or **Cancel** to exit.

The progress bar below the Back and ellipses buttons shows the current stage in the Pick, Pack, and Ship process. 

The main view shows a list of all items required for fulfillment of the order. Each item is displayed along with its image, SKU, color, and size, and whether or not value-added services (VAS) were ordered along with the item. 

Press on an item to open the Item Options menu. From here, you have the following choices:

**Manually pick:** Advances the popup to the Manual Pick screen. In the Manual Input dialog that appears, enter the item’s SKU number and adjust the plus and minus buttons for quick entry of multiple items with the same SKU. Select **Done** to continue. The Items section will be updated to reflect the item(s) you picked. 

**Product info:** Displays details about the product.

**Value added services:** Displays any special instructions for the item (e.g. installation, gift wrapping, etc.).

**Scratch item:** Allows you to mark the item in the order as unavailable because it is either Damaged, Out of stock, Not found, or On hold. Adjust the applicable quantities and click **Done** to save.

**Unpick item:** Only available for items that have already been picked. Selecting Unpick asks **Are you sure you want to unpick this item?** Select **Yes** to confirm.
