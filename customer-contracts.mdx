## Introduction

The Contracts page shows all previously created contracts in a sortable, filterable table. To sort the contracts, click on the Organization Name, Contract ID, Status, or Date Modified column headers. Use the Status, Start Date, and End Date drop-down menus to filter the contracts. The Search bar at the top allows you to find contracts by name, or contract ID. The **Add Contract** button at the top of the page allows you to create a new contract.

## Adding a Contract

To add a new contract, click the **Add Contract** button at the top of the page.

Set up the organization's Basic Information in the **Details** section. Use the Organization Name drop-down menu to select an organization you set up previously in the **Organizations** page. Use the date fields to enter the start and end dates for the organization’s contract.

Click **Next** or **Catalog** to connect the organization and its contract to a price list.

Price lists are set up independently in fabric Offers and allow you to control things like the base and maximum sale prices for items. Setting up individual price lists for each organization allows you to maintain contracted pricing.

Use the **Price List** drop-down menu to choose the price list you set up for this organization. A preview of the price list will appear at the bottom of the page.

The **On Contract** drop-down menu lets you select whether this organization’s price list was agreed upon in the contract. If you selected a specific price list in the previous field and set this field to Yes, the contracted price list will be used. If you set this field to No, the prices listed in the base price list will be used.

When the **Promotion Stacking** field is set to Yes, contracted prices are eligible for promotions. Setting the field to No prevents prices from being discounted beyond the lowest price listed in the associated price list.

When you’re finished creating the organization, click **Save** at the top of the page.

## Editing a Contract

To edit an existing contract, find and click on it in the table on the main Contracts page. On the contract details page, click the **Edit** button to make changes.

Use the **Draft** drop-down menu at the top to set the contract’s status, whether Draft, Active, or Inactive.

To make changes to the Details and Catalog sections, refer to **Adding a Contract** above.
