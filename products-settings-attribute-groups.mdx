### Overview

Attribute groups enable merchants to organize various attributes together based on meaning or purpose for an easier, more logical flow during the set up process.

For example, a furniture store might need to have height, width, length, or depth attributes present on the item or bundle listing page on their storefront. The merchant can create an attribute group called _dimensions_ so that all dimension-related details can be added in one place when adding a new piece of furniture. This allows merchants to streamline the setup process and reducing the time required to manage extensive attribute data in large catalogs.

Before creating attribute groups, you must first set up the attributes that you want to group together in the Attributes > Products page.

While attribute groups enhance storefront convenience, setting them up is optional and not mandatory for product setup.
