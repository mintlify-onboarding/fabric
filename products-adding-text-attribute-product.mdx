### Overview

Text attributes allow you to add text-based information about an item, such as a description or a code snippet. You can use any combination of text, numbers, or special characters for this attribute type.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have administrator privileges to fabric Products. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/docs/role-based-access-control).

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Attributes > Product**.  
The **Product Attributes** page is displayed.
2. Click **New Attribute**.  
The **Create product attribute** page is displayed. The **Text** attribute type is selected by default.
3. (Optional) To enable localized titles for the attribute, set the **Localize this attribute** toggle to one of the following:  
   * **On**: The attribute title is localized. The **Title and description** section displays additional **Attribute title** fields corresponding to the languages set up in [internationalization](https://fabric-group.readme.io/docs/internationalization-languages) settings.  
   * **Off**: The attribute title isn't localized.
4. In the **Attribute title (primary)** filed, enter a name for the attribute.  
If localization is enabled in step 3, enter the localized attribute titles in the **Attribute title** field for each corresponding internationalization setting.
5. (Optional) In the **Description** field, enter a description for the attribute.
6. In the **Type of text** field, select one of the following:  
   * Small text: For single-line text attributes.  
   * Text Area: For multi-line text attributes.  
   * Html: For text area attributes that support HTML.
7. In the **Use JavaScript formula to calculate value** field, select one of the following:  
   * **Yes**: Specifies that the value for the attribute is calculated using the JavaScript formula that you provide in the **Calculation formula** field. An example of a JavaScript formula is `(async () => await attribute('id') *10)()`. When you select **Yes**, the **Calculation formula** and **Allow manual overwrite** fields are displayed. Do the following to complete the settings:  
         1. In the **Calculation formula** field, enter a JavaScript formula.  
         2. In the **Allow manual overwrite** field, choose one of the following:  
                  * **Yes**: Specifies that you can manually overwrite the attribute value. When the **Use JavaScript formula to calculate value** setting is enabled, the system determines the value based on your provided formula. However, if you enable the manual overwrite option, you can replace the system-calculated value with a custom value during product attribute setup. For more information, see the [Adding an Item](/docs/products-adding-item) section.  
                  * **No**: Specifies that you cannot manually overwrite the attribute value. This is the default setting.  
   * **No**: Specifies that the attribute value is not calculated using a JavaScript formula.
8. In the **Validations** field, select one of the following:  
   * **None**: Specifies that no custom validation is required for the attribute. This is the default setting.  
   * **Custom JavaScript**: Specifies that the JavaScript you enter in the **Validation formula** field is used to validate the attribute.  
   The **Validation formula** field is displayed.  
         * In the **Validation formula** field, enter a JavaScript validation formula.
9. In the **Is this attribute mandatory?** field, select one of the following:  
   * **Yes**: Specifies that the attribute is mandatory when creating an item.  
   * **No**: Specifies that the attribute is not mandatory when creating an item. This is the default selection.
10. Click **Save**.

The text attribute with the specified settings is created.
