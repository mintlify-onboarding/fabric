## Introduction

As a retailer, you can manage your suppliers, see their details, and make changes to their accounts from the Supplier page.

To access the Supplier page, select **Suppliers** from the menu at the top. The Suppliers page features a dashboard that allows you to search for existing suppliers, invite new ones, and browse suppliers by status. There’s also a supplier calendar that allows you to look ahead at upcoming supplier events.

Use the search bar or the options under Browse Suppliers to find existing suppliers. Searching for or browsing suppliers displays a list of suppliers.

Clicking on a supplier’s name opens the Supplier Detail page.

## Supplier Detail Page

The Supplier Detail page shows information about the supplier, broken up in to four menus available at the left-hand side of the page: **Summary**, **Locations**, **Attributes**, and **Carriers**.

### Summary

Summary is the default view of the Supplier Detail menu. At the top of the Summary menu is a button that allows you to either Activate or Suspend the supplier, depending on the supplier’s status.

* **Activate** \- The Activate button is available for suppliers that have completed the onboarding process. You must click Activate in order to complete their onboarding process and enable their supplier account.
* **Suspend** \- The Suspend button is available for active suppliers that have completed onboarding. It allows you to suspend their status as your supplier at any time.

Below the status button, the Summary Menu shows basic information about the supplier. There are five sections: **Connection Detail**, **Payment Settings**, **SLAs**, **Contacts**, and **Settings**.
