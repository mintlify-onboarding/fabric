### Overview

Collections serve as an alternative to categories for organizing products, especially useful for short-term marketing campaigns. For example, a collection could be created for a summer sale featuring discounted furniture.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have created at least one category.

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Attributes > Collections**.  
The **Collections** page is displayed.
2. Click **Add Collection**.  
The **Add Collection** page is shown.
3. Click the **+** icon.
4. Enter a name and press **Enter**.
5. Mouse over the new collection and click the vertical ellipses (**â‹®**).
6. Click **Manage collection**.  
The **Manage collection** menu is displayed.
7. (Optional) To enable localized names for the collection, set the **Localize this selection** toggle to one of the following:  
   * **On**: The collection name is localized. The **Add Localized Names** section displays additional **Collection name** fields corresponding to the languages depending on the internationalization settings.  
         * Enter the localized titles in the **Collection name** field for each corresponding internationalization setting.  
   * **Off**: The collection name isn't localized.
8. To include categories as sources for the collection, in the **Sources menu**, click the checkboxes next to the corresponding categories or subcategories.
9. (Optional) To exclude categories or subcategories as sources for the collection, in the **Source Exclusions** menu, click the checkboxes next to the corresponding categories or subcategories.
10. (Optional) To include or exclude items from the collection based on an attribute, in the **Attribute rules** menu, click **Add new rule**.  
   * In the **If** dropdown, select an attribute.  
   * In the **Select a validation** dropdown, choose a validation rule.
11. Click **Save**.

The collection with the specified settings is now created.
