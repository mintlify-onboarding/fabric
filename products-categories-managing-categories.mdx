### Overview

Categories are hierarchical tree structures that allow you to organize items, variants, and bundles into groups based on similar attributes. This document covers the process of adding attributes to categories, renaming categories, and deleting categories.

### Adding Product Attributes

#### Overview

Item attributes are the attributes that an item, also called a product, must have configured in order to be added to a category.

Individual item attributes are set up in the Attributes section. Those product attributes can then be added to a category using the procedure below.

As an example, a home décor company might have a category for rugs and want to require any items added to that category to have length and width information. The attributes for dimensions would be set up in **Products > Attributes > Product** and then added to a category in **Products > Categories**.

It is required to set up a category’s product attributes prior to adding any items to it. If a category is missing item attributes, no item can be created for that category.

#### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Categories**.  
The **Categories** page is displayed.
2. Mouse over the desired category and click on the vertical ellipses (**⋮**) at the right.
3. Click **Product attributes**.  
The **Product attributes** menu is displayed.
4. Click the **Add Products Attributes** dropdown.  
The dropdown displays a list of category attributes as created in **Products > Attributes > Product**.
5. To add an attribute, click its corresponding checkbox. You can add as many attributes as needed.  
Note that system-mandatory attributes are separated for easier management. These attributes are shown by default, but need to be saved so that you can add to the category.
6. (Optional) To the right of a product attribute, click the vertical ellipses (**⋮**) and do the following:  
   * To make the attribute mandatory, click **Make attribute mandatory**.  
   * To remove the attribute, click **Remove attribute**.
7. Click **Save**.

The category attributes you selected are applied to the category and all of its subcategories.

### Adding Category Attributes

#### Overview

Category attributes allow you to apply a group of attributes to your category hierarchy. These attribute groups are set up in **Products > Attributes > Category**.

You can apply category attributes at the root level of your category hierarchy or at the subcategory level.

Subcategories inherit the category attributes applied to the parent category unless you select a different group of category attributes at the subcategory level.

#### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Categories**.  
The Categories page is displayed.
2. On the desired category click on the vertical ellipses (**⋮**) at the right.  
To apply category attributes to the entire category hierarchy, click on the vertical ellipses to the right of the Root menu.
3. Click **Category attributes**.  
The **Category Attributes** menu is displayed.
4. Click the **Add Category Attributes** dropdown.  
The dropdown menu displays a list of category attributes that are created in the **Products > Attributes > Category** page.
5. Click the attributes you would like to add.
6. Click **Save**.

The category attributes that you selected are applied to the category and its subcategories.
