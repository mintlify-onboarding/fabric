## Introduction

Batch Order Processing allows for multiple orders to be picked at the same time.

It can be done with or without a scanner.

## Batch Order Processing (with scanner)

To batch process an order with a scanner, click **Scan in Items** on the **Items** tab from the Fulfillments menu. 

The scan to pick items popup opens with a list of items that are required for the order to be fulfilled. 

As you pick items, the quantities are updated in the popup.

Once all items have been picked, click the **Done** button to save your changes.

## Batch Order Processing (without scanner)

To batch process an order without a scanner, begin on the Pending Orders menu and apply a filter. Once you have applied a filter, visit the **Items** tab. Click **Scan in Items** to begin batch order fulfillment.

Click the **Done** button at the bottom of the popup when youâ€™re finished scanning. 

The quantities will be updated on the Items tab. Click the View Orders button to return to the Orders tab.
