To invite a new supplier to your dropship program, click on **Suppliers** in the top navigation menu.

Click **Invite Supplier** in the upper right of the page.

Complete the **Supplier Info** section of the pop up form by entering the name of the supplier and the primary contacts first name, last name, and email address.

If the connection settings of the new supplier will be different than your accounts default settings, you can change those settings during the invite process by using the **Advanced Settings** on the invite form. 

NOTE: Your account default settings will be set during your initial retailer onboarding with the help of your Customer Success Manager.

To invite a new supplier who will have different account settings:

* Check **I want to override the settings below** box on the invite form
* Select the settings you wish to create for this supplier using the dropdowns  
   * Default Fulfillment SLA  
   * Payment Terms  
   * Cost Model  
   * Returns & Customer Service Allowance
* When the form is complete, click **Send Invitation**

Your new supplier will receive an email from the Marketplace Platform prompting them to sign in and begin the onboarding process. They will be guided through that process with the assistance of a fabric Supplier Onboarding Specialist.
