> ## ❗️
> 
> Marketplace (Vendors) is now called Marketplace (Suppliers)
> 
> Some of fabric's products are undergoing name changes. Marketplace (Merchants) is now Marketplace (Suppliers), but you may see the old name in some places as we make the transition.

fabric Marketplace combines ease of onboarding, technical implementation, day-to-day management, and promotional opportunities to make long-lasting, profitable connections with retailers.
