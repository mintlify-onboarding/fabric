title: "Adding a Date Attribute"
---

### Overview

Date attributes allow you to add date-related information about an item.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have administrator privileges to fabric Products. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/docs/role-based-access-control).

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Attributes > Product**.  
The **Product Attributes** page is displayed.
2. Click **New Attribute**.  
The **Create product attribute** page is displayed.
3. Select **Date**.
4. In the **Attribute title** filed, enter a name for the attribute.
5. In the **Select date format** field, select a date format.  
Note that bulk import of the date attribute type uses the date format you select here. The selected date format cannot be changed. If the format needs to be changed, you must delete the attribute and create it again using the required format.
6. (Optional) In the **Description** field, enter a description for the attribute.
7. In the **Use JavaScript formula to calculate value** field, select one of the following:  
   * **Yes**: Specifies that the value for the attribute is calculated using the JavaScript formula that you provide in the **Calculation formula** field. An example of a JavaScript formula is `(async () => await attribute('id') *10)()`. When you select **Yes**, the **Calculation formula** and **Allow manual overwrite** fields are displayed. Do the following to complete the settings:  
         1. In the **Calculation formula** field, enter a JavaScript formula.  
         2. In the **Allow manual overwrite** field, choose one of the following:  
                  * **Yes**: Specifies that you can manually overwrite the attribute value. When the **Use JavaScript formula to calculate value** setting is enabled, the system determines the value based on your provided formula. However, if you enable the manual overwrite option, you can replace the system-calculated value with a custom value during product attribute setup. For more information, see the [Adding an Item](/docs/products-adding-item) section.  
                  * **No**: Specifies that you cannot manually overwrite the attribute value. This is the default setting.  
   * **No**: Specifies that the attribute value is not calculated using a JavaScript formula.
8. In the **Validations** field, select one of the following:  
   * **None**: Specifies that no custom validation is required for the attribute. This is the default setting.  
   * **Custom JavaScript**: Specifies that the JavaScript you enter in the **Validation formula** field is used to validate the attribute.  
   The **Validation formula** field is displayed.  
         * In the **Validation formula** field, enter a JavaScript validation formula.
9. In the **Is this attribute mandatory?** field, select one of the following:  
   * **Yes**: Specifies that the attribute is mandatory when creating an item.  
   * **No**: Specifies that the attribute is not mandatory when creating an item. This is the default selection.
10. Click **Save**.

The date attribute with the specified settings is created.
