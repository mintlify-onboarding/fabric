## Overview

Experiences can be configured to provide content for many different sales channels on multiple devices simultaneously including web stores, mobile apps, or in-store kiosks. Bespoke home pages, landing pages, menus, headers, and footers can then be created for each channel.

Content can be assigned to multiple channels where to keep it consistent. Policy and other ancillary pages are good examples. This enables you the flexibility to manage content in one place for all channels.

**Distinct Brands**

Retailers often have multiple brands, each aimed at specific target segments. A channel can be created for each brand enabling content across the brand site to maintain a consistent look, feel, and tone.

**Focused Product Category Sites**

A channel can be created for an experience focused on a specific product category such as a site that only merchandizes plumbing products for a home improvement retailer. Alternatively, distinct channels can also support focused web stores for major categories allowing you to tailor content to that specific audience and product mix.

**Location**

Channels can be leveraged to have distinct experiences for certain locations. These can be different regions such as separate sites for the US and Canada. Alternatively, a channel can be based on a physical store to enable content to be customized for the needs of each geographic location or individual store.

**Devices**

Channels can be set up for devices, such as a mobile app. Distinct content can be created optimized to this form factor and the specific experience you want for app users.
