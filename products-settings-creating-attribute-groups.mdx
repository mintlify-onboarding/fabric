### Overview

Attribute groups enable merchants to organize various attributes together based on meaning or purpose for an easier, more logical flow during the item and bundle set up process.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have created multiple product attributes.

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Products > Settings > Attribute Groups**.  
The **Product Settings** page is displayed.
2. Click **Create Attribute Group**.  
The **Create Attribute Group** page is displayed.
3. In the **Attribute group title** field, enter a title for the attribute group.
4. (Optional) In the **Description** field, enter a description for the attribute group.
5. In the **Priority order** field, enter a number.  
The attribute group's position on the **Add Item** or **Add Bundle** pages is determined by its Priority order valueâ€”lower numbers indicate higher priority.
6. To add attributes to the group, do one of the following:  
   * In the **Editable attributes** menu, click **Add attributes**.  
   The **Select attributes** window is displayed.  
         * To add an attribute, click its corresponding checkbox.

         * When finished selecting attributes, click **Add**.  
         The attributes are added to the group.
