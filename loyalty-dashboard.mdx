## Introduction

Across the top of the Dashboard, there are running totals showing the number of members in your loyalty program and the number of points used and available.

The Member Enrollment graph displays member acquisition over the last month and the Total Members Per Status graph show member behavior.

* Active Members are active in the program
* Inactive Members have not made any transactions in the past two years
* Merged Members have had their accounts merged into another member account
* Deleted Members have had their accounts removed.
